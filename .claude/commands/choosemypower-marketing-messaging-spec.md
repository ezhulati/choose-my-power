# ChooseMyPower Marketing Messaging Specification

## Core Positioning

### The Right Frame
**Texas electricity choice = ADVANTAGE**
- Position choice as the Texas advantage vs monopoly states
- Celebrate competition bringing better rates
- Frame choice as power and freedom

### The Problem We Solve
**The comparison work = THE TEDIOUS PART**
- Comparing 47 providers is exhausting
- Reading 940 plan details takes forever
- Calculating actual costs requires spreadsheets
- We make the research part quick and painless

## Messaging Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO Say:
- "Texas gives you the power to choose"
- "You get to pick your rate (most states can't)"
- "47 providers competing for your business"
- "Real competition means better rates"
- "The choice is great, the homework isn't"
- "Comparing plans is the tedious part"
- "We make the research quick"
- "Skip the spreadsheets"

### ❌ DON'T Say:
- "Texas forces you to choose"
- "You have to pick a provider"
- "Texas doesn't give you a default"
- "You're stuck choosing"
- "The burden of choice"
- "Forced to compare"
- "Required to select"
- "Must choose or else"

## Key Messaging Patterns

### Opening Lines That Work:
1. "Texas gives you something California doesn't - choice in electricity providers"
2. "You've got 47 companies competing for your business"
3. "In Texas, you pick your rate. The comparing part? We handle that."
4. "Real competition, real savings - but who has time to compare?"

### Problem/Solution Framework:
**Old (Wrong):** "Texas makes you choose → We make it easy"
**New (Right):** "Choice is great, comparing isn't → We do the comparing"

### Comparison to Other States:
- Always position Texas choice as superior to monopolies
- Reference states where people are stuck with one utility
- Show how competition benefits consumers

## Content Examples

### Homepage Hero:
**Wrong:** "Texas doesn't give you a default electricity provider. You have to choose from 47 companies or pay double."

**Right:** "Texas gives you what most states don't - real choice in electricity providers. 47 companies competing means better rates. The catch? Comparing them all takes forever. We already did that work."

### Moving Guide:
**Wrong:** "Welcome to Texas! You're forced to pick your own electricity company."

**Right:** "Welcome to Texas! Unlike most states, you actually get to choose your electricity rate. The freedom is fantastic - the comparison work, not so much. We'll handle that part."

### FAQ Answer:
**Wrong:** "In Texas, you must choose an electricity provider before getting service."

**Right:** "In deregulated Texas, you get to choose your electricity provider - a freedom most states don't offer. Pick the best rate for your needs."

## Tone Guidelines

### Acknowledge Reality Without Negativity:
- Yes, comparing is tedious (but choice itself is good)
- Yes, it takes time (but competition saves money)
- Yes, there are too many options (but options beat monopolies)

### Celebrate the Choice:
- Texas electricity freedom
- Power to the people
- Competition benefits consumers
- You're in control

### Position Us as the Solution:
- We love the choice, hate the homework
- We've done the research
- We've compared them all
- Skip straight to the good ones

## Implementation Checklist

When writing new content:
1. ✓ Is choice positioned as positive?
2. ✓ Is the work/research the problem, not the choice?
3. ✓ Do we celebrate Texas deregulation?
4. ✓ Do we solve the comparison problem?
5. ✓ Are we avoiding "forced/must/required" language?

## The One-Liner Test

Every piece of content should pass this test:
"Would a Texan be proud of having electricity choice after reading this?"

If the answer is no, rewrite it.

**Remember:** Texans are proud of their independence and freedom to choose. Never make that choice sound like a burden. The burden is the research work - and that's exactly what we solve.
