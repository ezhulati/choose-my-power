## Messaging Patterns by Page Type

### 1. Homepage & Core Navigation Pages

#### Headlines Formula
```
PRIMARY: "Finally. [Specific Relief Statement]"
SECONDARY: "[Reality Check] + [What We Do Instead]"
```

#### Examples:
- **Homepage**: "Finally. Texas Electricity That Makes Sense."
  - Sub: "No more 6.9¢ rates that cost 14¢. No more 40-page contracts."

- **Compare Plans**: "Finally. Real Electricity Prices (Not Marketing Tricks)"
  - Sub: "We show what plans actually cost you, not the teaser rate"

- **Shop Page**: "Finally. Shopping for Electricity Without the BS"
  - Sub: "No spam forms. No pushy salespeople. Just clear choices."

- **Providers Page**: "Finally. Honest Reviews of Texas Electric Companies"
  - Sub: "We tell you what each provider is actually like to deal with"

---

### 2. City Pages (880+ Texas Cities)

#### Headline Formula
```
PRIMARY: "Finally. [City] Electricity That Makes Sense"
SECONDARY: "[Local Pain Point] + [Our Solution]"
```

#### Templates by City Size:

**Major Cities (Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio)**
- Headline: "Finally. [City] Electricity That Makes Sense"
- Sub: "Moving to [City]? Don't transfer your old plan. We found [[planCount]] quality options that actually match your new home's needs."
- Key Message: Acknowledge competitive market confusion

**Mid-Size Cities (Plano, Irving, Arlington)**
- Headline: "Finally. [City] Electricity Without the Games"
- Sub: "[City] families save $[[avgSavings]]/year when they stop falling for teaser rates. Here's what's really available."
- Key Message: Focus on suburban family savings

**Small Cities (Under 50K)**
- Headline: "Finally. Real Electricity Options for [City]"
- Sub: "Just because [City] is smaller doesn't mean you should pay more. [[planCount]] fair plans available."
- Key Message: Address limited options perception

#### Moving-Specific Messaging
Always include this warning block on city pages:
```
"Moving to [City]? Here's why transferring your old plan usually backfires:
• Your old rate was based on your OLD home's size
• 'Fixed' rates aren't fixed - they change with usage
• A plan for a 2-bedroom apartment costs way more in a 4-bedroom house
Let's find a plan for your NEW home instead. Takes 10 minutes."
```

### 3. Faceted Navigation Pages (2,500+ combinations)

  - Sub: "Short-term doesn't mean expensive. [[planCount]] fair options."

- **Month-to-Month**: "Finally. Flexible Plans That Don't Punish You"
  - Sub: "No contracts doesn't mean triple the price anymore."

**Plan Type Filters**
- **Fixed Rate**: "Finally. Fixed Rates That Are Actually Fixed"

  - Sub: "We show when variable beats fixed (hint: rarely, but sometimes)."

- **Indexed**: "Finally. Indexed Plans Explained Honestly"
  - Sub: "Complex? Yes. Right for you? We'll help you figure that out."

**Feature Filters**

- **No Deposit**: "Finally. $0 Deposit Plans That Don't Suck"

## Key Messaging Elements

### Trust Builders
Always include these reality checks:
- "We only show [[planCount]] quality plans, not overwhelming lists"
- "No teaser rates, no fine print surprises"
- "The electricity companies pay us, you pay the same either way"
- "No email required, no spam, no sales calls"

### Urgency Without Pressure
Frame urgency around their situation, not false scarcity:
- "Moving tomorrow? We'll get you sorted in 10 minutes"
- "Rate just jumped? Let's fix that today"
- "Contract ending? Beat the auto-renewal trap"

### Social Proof Patterns
- "[[cityCount]] Texas families saved $[[amount]] last month"
- "Your neighbors in [[city]] are already saving"
- "[[percentage]]% find their plan in under 10 minutes"

### Objection Handlers

**"It's too complicated"**
Response: "That's what they want you to think. We make it simple."

**"They're all the same"**
Response: "They're not. We found [[amount]] difference between highest and lowest."

**"I don't have time"**
Response: "10 minutes now saves $[[amount]]/year. Worth it?"

**"My current plan is fine"**
Response: "When did you last check? Rates changed [[timeframe]]."

## Forbidden Patterns to Eliminate

### Never Use These Phrases
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Revolutionary platform"
- "Cutting-edge technology"
- "Seamless experience"
- "Comprehensive solution"
- "Best-in-class"
- "Industry-leading"
- "Transform your electricity"
- "Empower your choice"
- "Navigate the landscape"

### Avoid These Structures
- "It's not just about X, it's about Y"
- "In today's [adjective] world..."
- "Have you ever wondered...?"
- "Enter: [solution]"
- "The best part?"
- "Here's the kicker"
- Triple parallels in every paragraph
- Wikipedia-style neutral voice

### Replace Corporate Speak
- ❌ "Leverage our platform" → ✅ "Use our tools"
- ❌ "Optimize your selection" → ✅ "Pick the right plan"
- ❌ "Facilitate your decision" → ✅ "Help you choose"
- ❌ "Comprehensive analysis" → ✅ "We checked everything"
- ❌ "Robust comparison" → ✅ "Clear comparison"
