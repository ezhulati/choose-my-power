## Test Coverage

| Test Type | Status | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Unit Tests | 🔴 | 0% |
| Integration Tests | 🔴 | 0% |
| E2E Tests | 🔴 | 0% |
| Manual Testing | 🔴 | 0% |

## Known Issues & Blockers

1. **Database Seeding**: Need to confirm all real data is in database
2. **Performance**: Unknown impact of switching from static to dynamic data
3. **Caching Strategy**: May need Redis caching for frequently accessed data
4. **API Rate Limits**: Need to ensure we don't hit ComparePower API limits

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Missing data in DB | Medium | High | Verify data completeness first |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Implement caching layer |
| Breaking changes | Low | High | Comprehensive testing |
| Incomplete removal | Medium | High | Automated scanning for imports |

## Daily Log

### 2025-09-06
