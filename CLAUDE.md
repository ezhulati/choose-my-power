```
/electricity-plans/                          # Hub page
/electricity-plans/dallas-tx/                # City pages (Tier 1 - Priority 1.0)
/electricity-plans/dallas-tx/12-month/       # Single filters (Tier 2 - Priority 0.8)  
/electricity-plans/dallas-tx/12-month/fixed-rate/ # Combinations (Tier 3 - Priority 0.6)
```

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// ComparePower API Call Pattern
GET https://pricing.api.comparepower.com/api/plans/current?group=default&tdsp_duns=103994067400&display_usage=1000&term=12&percent_green=100
