## Implementation Notes

1. **Always use specific numbers** - $420, 10 minutes, 47 pages
2. **Name the villain** - PowerToChoose, confusing companies
3. **Admit what we don't know** - "We can't guarantee X"
4. **Use parenthetical asides** - (unfortunately), (the real number)
5. **Mix sentence lengths** - Short punch. Then a longer explanation that provides context.
6. **Include contradictions** - "Want cheap? But also reliable? It's tricky."
7. **Sound like a helpful friend** - Not a corporation, not a salesperson

## Final Reality Check

✅ Would you say this to someone at a coffee shop?
