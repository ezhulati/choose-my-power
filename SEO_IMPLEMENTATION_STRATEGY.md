- **Priority scoring** for sitemap generation

#### Canonical Rules:
- Single high-value filters: Self-canonical

- **Related page discovery** for similar filter combinations
- **Breadcrumb navigation** with schema markup

#### Linking Strategy:
- City pages as distribution hubs
- Filter pages as specialized spokes
