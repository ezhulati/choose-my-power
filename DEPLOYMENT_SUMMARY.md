- **CHANGELOG Updated**: Added entry for ZIP lookup navigation fix
- **Commit Hash**: `b47f798`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Push Status**: Successfully pushed to origin/main

### Fix Details
The deployment successfully addressed critical ZIP lookup navigation failures with the following improvements:

1. **API Request Headers**: Added proper `Accept: application/json` headers to ensure correct response format
2. **Fallback URL Handling**: Replaced problematic API URL fallbacks with user-friendly page navigation
3. **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling to gracefully redirect users to contextually appropriate pages
4. **Intelligent Routing**: Implemented ZIP pattern detection (7xxxx = Texas) for smart fallback routing

### Testing Confirmation
âœ… Development server running successfully on port 4324
âœ… ZIP lookup API calls working correctly (confirmed with 75201 -> dallas)
âœ… Navigation fallbacks redirect to appropriate user-facing pages
âœ… No console errors or navigation failures

### Production Impact
Users will now experience:
- Reliable form submissions with proper redirects
- No more raw JSON responses or API endpoints exposed
- Graceful degradation when API issues occur
- Always land on valid, contextually relevant pages

### Next Steps
1. Monitor production deployment on Netlify
2. Verify ZIP lookup functionality across different ZIP codes
3. Check error logs for any edge cases
4. Consider adding analytics to track fallback usage
