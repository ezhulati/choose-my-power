## üö® PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT

**Current Status:** 80% Ready

3. Provider-specific filtering expected by users

**Estimated Time to Production Ready:** 3-5 days with focused development

**Recommendation:** Address Phase 1 critical fixes before any production deployment. The core application is solid and the missing pieces are primarily data/content related rather than architectural issues.
