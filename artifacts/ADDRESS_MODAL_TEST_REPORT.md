# Address Search Modal Test Report

**Test Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Test URL**: `http://localhost:4324/electricity-plans/plans/rhythm-energy/rhythm-saver-12`  
**Test Objective**: Verify the address search modal functionality and ComparePower URL generation  

## Executive Summary

❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**: The address search modal functionality is currently non-functional due to multiple React SSR (Server-Side Rendering) compatibility issues and compilation errors.

### Key Findings

1. **React Hook Compatibility Issues**: Components using React hooks are failing during server-side rendering
2. **Missing Client-Side Directives**: Several React components lack proper `"use client"` directives
3. **Compilation Errors**: Multiple syntax errors preventing proper application build
4. **Component Hydration Failures**: Client-side components are not hydrating properly

## Test Execution Results

### Plan Page Loading Status
- ✅ **Homepage**: Loads successfully with full functionality
- ❌ **Plan Page**: Loads basic shell but React components fail to render
- ❌ **Modal Component**: Not accessible due to component rendering failures

### Component Analysis

#### 1. Dialog Component Issues
**File**: `/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- ✅ Has `"use client"` directive
- ❌ Still failing during SSR due to Radix UI hooks usage

#### 2. Address Search Modal
**File**: `/src/components/ui/AddressSearchModal.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed: Added `"use client"` directive
- ❌ Still not rendering due to parent component issues

#### 3. Product Details Page
**File**: `/src/components/ui/ProductDetailsPageShadcn.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed: Added `"use client"` directive
- ❌ Component hydration failing due to compilation errors

#### 4. Astro Integration
**File**: `/src/pages/electricity-plans/plans/[provider]/[plan].astro`
- ✅ Fixed: Changed from `client:load` to `client:only="react"`
- ❌ Still failing due to underlying component errors

### Error Categories

#### A. React SSR Errors
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')
at Module.useRef (/Users/mbp-ez/node_modules/react/cjs/react.development.js:1630:21)
at Dialog (file:///Users/mbp-ez/node_modules/@radix-ui/react-dialog/dist/index.mjs:32:28)
```

#### B. Vite/Build Errors
```
[ERROR] Failed to scan for dependencies from entries
[ERROR] Expected ":" but found ";"
[ERROR] Unexpected closing "div" tag does not match opening "EnhancedSectionReact" tag
```

#### C. Component Hydration Errors
```
[ERROR] [astro-island] Error hydrating /src/components/ui/ProductDetailsPageShadcn.tsx 
TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module
```

## Current Modal Functionality Status

### Expected Workflow (Not Working)
1. ❌ User navigates to plan page → Page renders with errors
2. ❌ User clicks "Select This Plan" → Button not visible due to component failure
3. ❌ Modal opens with address form → Modal component not rendering
4. ❌ User fills address: "3031 Oliver st Apt 1214" → Form not accessible
5. ❌ User fills ZIP: "75205" → Form not accessible
6. ❌ User clicks "Check Availability" → Button not accessible
7. ❌ ESIID results display → API integration not testable
8. ❌ User selects ESIID: "10443720007962125" → Selection not possible
9. ❌ User clicks "Order This Plan" → Final step not reachable
10. ❌ URL opens: `https://orders.comparepower.com/order/service_location?esiid=10443720007962125&plan_id=rhythm-saver-12&zip_code=75205&usage=1000` → Cannot validate

### What Is Currently Working
- ✅ Homepage loads and displays correctly
- ✅ Basic site navigation functions
- ✅ Development server is running (port 4324)
- ✅ Network requests are being made
- ✅ CSS and styling are loading properly

### What Is NOT Working
- ❌ React components on plan pages
- ❌ Address search modal
- ❌ Interactive form elements
- ❌ ComparePower integration
- ❌ Complete user workflow

## Technical Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues

#### 1. **Radix UI SSR Incompatibility**
The `@radix-ui/react-dialog` component is attempting to use React hooks during server-side rendering, which is not supported. Even with `"use client"` directives, the component is still being processed on the server.

**Solution Required**: 
- Implement dynamic imports with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`
- Or use a different modal library that's SSR-compatible
- Or restructure to ensure components only render client-side

#### 2. **Build Configuration Issues**
Multiple syntax errors in TypeScript/React files are preventing proper compilation:
- Missing semicolons in `ZipCodeSearchAPI.tsx`
- Mismatched JSX tags in various page components
- TypeScript parsing errors

#### 3. **Component Architecture Problems**
The current architecture mixes server-side and client-side components inappropriately, causing hydration mismatches.

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fixes Required (Priority 1)

#### 1. Fix Compilation Errors
```bash
# Fix syntax errors in these files:
src/components/ZipCodeSearchAPI.tsx:256:8 (missing semicolon)
src/pages/_components/ProviderPage.tsx:205-208 (mismatched tags)
src/pages/_components/StateElectricityPlansPage.tsx:130-133 (mismatched tags)
src/pages/_components/StateElectricityProvidersPage.tsx:140-143 (mismatched tags)
```

#### 2. Implement Proper SSR-Safe Modal
Replace the current Dialog implementation with an SSR-safe alternative:

```tsx
// Option 1: Dynamic import with lazy loading
const AddressSearchModal = lazy(() => import('./AddressSearchModal'));

// Option 2: Conditional rendering
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setIsClient(true), []);

return (
  <>
    {isClient && (
      <AddressSearchModal {...props} />
    )}
  </>
);
```

#### 3. Update Astro Component Loading
```astro
<!-- Use client:visible or client:idle instead of client:only -->
<ProductDetailsPageShadcn planData={planData} client:visible />
```

### Long-term Improvements (Priority 2)

#### 1. **Component Separation**
- Separate server-side and client-side components clearly
- Create a dedicated client-side wrapper for interactive components
- Implement proper error boundaries

#### 2. **Testing Infrastructure**
- Set up proper testing environment that doesn't require compilation
- Create mock components for testing UI flows
- Implement integration tests for the full workflow

#### 3. **Modal Architecture Redesign**
- Consider using a more SSR-friendly modal solution
- Implement proper state management for modal data
- Add proper error handling and loading states

## Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Issues |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Plan Page Rendering | ❌ Failed | React SSR errors, compilation errors |
| Address Search Modal | ❌ Not Accessible | Component not rendering |
| Form Functionality | ❌ Not Testable | Components not loading |
| ESIID Selection | ❌ Not Testable | Modal not accessible |
| ComparePower URL Generation | ❌ Not Testable | Workflow not reachable |

## Next Steps

### To Resume Testing
1. **Fix compilation errors** in the identified files
2. **Implement SSR-safe modal solution** 
3. **Restart development server** with clean build
4. **Re-run comprehensive tests** to validate functionality

### To Implement Address Modal Testing
Once the technical issues are resolved, the testing workflow should be:

1. Navigate to plan page and verify components render
2. Click "Select This Plan" button
3. Verify modal opens with proper form fields
4. Fill address: "3031 Oliver st Apt 1214" 
5. Fill ZIP: "75205"
6. Click "Check Availability" and wait for API response
7. Select ESIID: "10443720007962125"
8. Click "Order This Plan" 
9. **Capture and validate final URL**: `https://orders.comparepower.com/order/service_location?esiid=10443720007962125&plan_id=rhythm-saver-12&zip_code=75205&usage=1000`

## Files Modified During Investigation

1. `/src/components/ui/AddressSearchModal.tsx` - Added `"use client"` directive
2. `/src/components/ui/ProductDetailsPageShadcn.tsx` - Added `"use client"` directive  
3. `/src/pages/electricity-plans/plans/[provider]/[plan].astro` - Changed to `client:only="react"`

## Conclusion

The address search modal functionality cannot be tested in its current state due to multiple technical issues preventing proper component rendering. The issues are fixable but require addressing the underlying React SSR compatibility problems and compilation errors before the modal workflow can be validated.

**Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE TECHNICAL RESOLUTION**
