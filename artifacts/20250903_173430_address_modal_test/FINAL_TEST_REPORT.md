# Address Search Modal Test Report
## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Test Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Test Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Test Status:** ‚ùå FAILED - Critical Issues Found  

---

## Executive Summary

The address search modal test has **FAILED** due to multiple critical issues in the JavaScript implementation. While the modal UI displays correctly and shows a "success" state, the underlying functionality to pass parameters to ComparePower is broken.

### Issues Identified:

1. **üö® ESIID Variable Not Captured** - `selectedESIID` remains undefined
2. **üö® ZIP Code Not Captured** - `selectedZipCode` remains undefined  
3. **üö® JavaScript Error** - `planData is not defined` in `proceedToOrder` function
4. **üö® No URL Generation** - Order button does not generate the ComparePower URL

---

## Test Execution Results

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Modal opens correctly when "Select This Plan" is clicked
- Address and ZIP code input fields accept user input
- ERCOT API search executes successfully 
- ESIID results are displayed in the modal
- UI transitions correctly to "success" state
- Order button is present and clickable

### ‚ùå Broken Components
- ESIID selection does not capture the `selectedESIID` variable
- ZIP code is not stored in `selectedZipCode` variable
- `proceedToOrder()` function fails with "planData is not defined"
- No external URL is generated or opened
- Parameters are never passed to ComparePower

---

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### JavaScript Variable State (Debug Results)
```json
{
  "selectedESIID": undefined,
  "selectedAddress": undefined, 
  "selectedZipCode": undefined,
  "modalVisible": true,
  "successStepVisible": true,
  "orderButtonExists": true
}
```

### Expected vs Actual URL
**Expected URL:**
```
https://orders.comparepower.com/order/service_location?esiid=XXXXXXXXX&plan_id=rhythm-saver-12&zip_code=75205&usage=1000
```

**Actual URL:**
```
No URL generated - function fails before URL construction
```

### Error Analysis
The `proceedToOrder()` function contains a template literal reference to `${planData.id}` and `${planData.provider.name}`, but `planData` is not available in the JavaScript scope, causing the function to fail immediately.

---

## Code Issues Found

### 1. ESIID Selection Function (selectLocation)
**Issue:** The `selectLocation` function is called correctly but doesn't properly set the global variables.

**Expected Behavior:** 
```javascript
selectedESIID = esiid;
selectedZipCode = zip;
```

**Actual Behavior:** Variables remain undefined

### 2. Template Literal Error in proceedToOrder
**Issue:** The function references `${planData.id}` and `${planData.provider.name}` but planData is not defined in JavaScript scope.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const orderUrl = `https://orders.comparepower.com/order/service_location?esiid=${selectedESIID}&plan_id=${planData.id}&zip_code=${selectedZipCode}&usage=1000`;
```

**Problem:** `planData` is an Astro server-side variable, not available in client-side JavaScript.

### 3. Variable Scope Issues
The JavaScript variables are declared but not properly populated when user interactions occur.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Template Literal Scope Error
The `proceedToOrder()` function tries to access `${planData.id}` and `${planData.provider.name}` in client-side JavaScript, but these are Astro server-side variables that don't exist in the browser scope.

### Secondary Issue: Variable Assignment Failure  
The `selectLocation()` function appears to execute but doesn't properly assign values to the global variables `selectedESIID` and `selectedZipCode`.

---

## Required Fixes

### 1. Fix Template Literal References (HIGH PRIORITY)
Replace server-side template literals with actual values or client-side accessible variables:

```javascript
// Instead of: ${planData.id}
// Use: 'rhythm-saver-12' (or pass as data attribute)

// Instead of: ${planData.provider.name}  
// Use: 'Rhythm Energy' (or pass as data attribute)
```

### 2. Debug Variable Assignment (HIGH PRIORITY)
Investigate why `selectLocation()` function doesn't properly set the global variables:

```javascript
function selectLocation(esiid, address, city, state, zip) {
  console.log('Setting variables:', { esiid, zip }); // Add debug logging
  selectedESIID = esiid;
  selectedZipCode = zip;
  console.log('Variables set:', { selectedESIID, selectedZipCode }); // Verify assignment
}
```

### 3. Add Error Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Implement proper error handling and user feedback for failed operations.

---

## Test Evidence

### API Integration Status
- ‚úÖ ERCOT search API returns results
- ‚úÖ Address validation API responds correctly  
- ‚úÖ UI displays search results properly
- ‚ùå Final URL generation fails
- ‚ùå No redirection to ComparePower occurs

### User Experience Impact
- Users see "Plan Available!" success message
- Users can click "Order This Plan" button
- **BUT** nothing happens - no redirect occurs
- Users are left with no indication of failure
- Critical business flow is completely broken

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix the planData template literal references** - Replace with hardcoded values or data attributes
2. **Debug the variable assignment issue** - Add console logging to track variable state
3. **Test the fixed implementation** - Re-run this test suite to verify fixes
4. **Add user feedback** - Show error messages when operations fail

### Testing Approach:
1. Fix the identified issues
2. Re-run the complete test suite
3. Verify that all required parameters (esiid, plan_id, zip_code, usage) are present in the final URL
4. Test with multiple addresses to ensure consistency

## Conclusion

**CRITICAL:** The address search modal is currently non-functional for its primary purpose of redirecting users to ComparePower with the correct parameters. While the UI appears to work correctly, the underlying JavaScript has multiple critical errors that prevent the business flow from completing.

This represents a **complete failure** of the order process and would result in **zero conversions** from users attempting to order plans through the modal.

**Priority:** IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

The issues identified are relatively straightforward to fix but require immediate attention to restore functionality.
