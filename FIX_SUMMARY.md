# ZIP Lookup Form Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The ZIP code lookup form on the homepage was failing to navigate users to the correct city pages after entering a ZIP code. The form would submit but users would see errors or incorrect navigation.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Missing Accept Header**: The JavaScript fetch request in `/public/js/zip-lookup.js` was not explicitly requesting JSON, causing the API to sometimes return HTML redirects instead of JSON data.
2. **Incorrect Fallback URLs**: When errors occurred, the script was trying to navigate to API endpoints (`/api/zip-lookup`) instead of user-facing pages.
3. **API Endpoint Behavior**: The API was checking the Accept header to determine whether to return JSON or perform redirects, but the client wasn't sending the correct header.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Accept Header (Line 186-190)
```javascript
const res = await fetch(url, { 
  redirect: 'follow',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

### 2. Fixed Fallback URLs (Multiple locations)
- **Line 221**: Changed fallback from API URL to `/texas/electricity-providers` or `/locations`
- **Line 276**: Changed final fallback from API URL to `/texas/electricity-providers`  
- **Line 316-324**: Added intelligent ZIP-based routing for error cases

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper fallback pages based on ZIP code patterns
- Texas ZIPs (starting with 7) → `/texas/electricity-providers`
- Non-Texas ZIPs → `/locations`

## Files Modified
- `/public/js/zip-lookup.js` - Main fix implementation

## Testing Results
✅ API with `Accept: application/json` returns proper JSON response
✅ API with `Accept: text/html` returns 302 redirect as expected
✅ Error cases now navigate to appropriate user-facing pages
✅ Form submission works correctly with valid Texas ZIP codes

## Impact
The ZIP lookup form now works reliably, providing users with:
- Proper navigation to city-specific pages
- Graceful fallbacks for error scenarios
- Consistent behavior across different browser environments
- Better user experience with no broken navigation

## Verification Steps
1. Visit homepage at http://localhost:4324
2. Enter a valid Texas ZIP code (e.g., 75201)
3. Click "Find Plans" button
4. Verify navigation to correct city page (/texas/dallas)
5. Test with invalid ZIP to verify fallback behavior

The fixes ensure that the critical user journey of ZIP code lookup works correctly, enabling users to find electricity plans for their area.
