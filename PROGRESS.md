# PROGRESS.md - ZIP Lookup Form Fix Implementation

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Research & Specification ‚úÖ
- Completed requirements gathering
- Analyzed codebase structure
- Created SPEC.md with detailed findings

### Phase 2: Planning ‚úÖ  
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md
- Prioritized fixes based on criticality
- Defined clear implementation steps

### Phase 3: Implementation üöß

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix API Request Headers ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
- [x] Identified issue: zip-lookup.js missing Accept header
- [x] API endpoint checks Accept header for HTML vs JSON
- [x] Added explicit Accept: application/json header to fetch request
- [x] Fixed issue where HTML was being returned instead of JSON

### Step 2: Improve Fallback URL Construction ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
- [x] Fixed all fallback URLs to use user-facing pages instead of API endpoints
- [x] Replaced API endpoint fallbacks with /texas/electricity-providers
- [x] Added intelligent ZIP-based routing (Texas vs non-Texas)
- [x] Updated error handlers to navigate to appropriate pages

### Step 3: Enhance Error Handling ‚è±Ô∏è
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Add comprehensive error states
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanisms

### Step 4: Improve State Management ‚è±Ô∏è
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Fix loading state transitions
- [ ] Add proper cleanup

### Step 5: Add Input Validation ‚è±Ô∏è
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Implement 5-digit ZIP validation
- [ ] Add visual feedback

### Step 6: Test & Verify ‚è±Ô∏è
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Test all edge cases
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## Current Focus
Completed Steps 1 & 2. Testing the ZIP form functionality.
All critical fixes implemented - form should now work properly.

## Important Decisions
- Following incremental implementation approach
- Testing after each step before proceeding
- Maintaining backward compatibility

## Next Actions
1. Implement Accept header fix in ZIP form component
2. Test form submission with various ZIP codes
3. Proceed to Step 2 if successful
