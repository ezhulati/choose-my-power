# Houston ZIP Code Testing - Critical Issues Found

**Test Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Test Scope:** ZIP code 77002 submission and Houston page functionality  
**Status:** ðŸš¨ **MULTIPLE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

## Executive Summary

The Houston ZIP code test revealed multiple critical issues that explain the user's reported problems:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations** - JavaScript is completely blocked
2. **Duplicate TX in Page Title** - SEO and branding issue  
3. **Missing Forms on Destination Pages** - No ZIP lookup functionality after redirect
4. **Script Loading Failures** - Critical JavaScript files cannot execute

## Detailed Findings

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue 1: Content Security Policy Violations

**Problem:** The live site has a restrictive CSP that blocks all JavaScript execution.

**Evidence:**
```
Refused to load the script '/js/zip-lookup.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'nonce-4WWPapEpE7saZlChnN8RBg==' 'strict-dynamic'"
```

**Impact:**
- ZIP lookup JavaScript cannot execute
- Interactive features are completely broken
- Forms cannot submit via JavaScript
- No client-side validation works

**Root Cause:** The CSP is configured with nonce-based script loading but:
- `/js/zip-lookup.js` is not served with the required nonce
- Inline scripts lack proper nonces
- Astro-generated scripts are blocked

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue 2: Page Title Duplication

**Problem:** Houston page shows "Best Electricity Plans in Houston TX, TX"

**Evidence:**
```
Page Title: Best Electricity Plans in Houston TX, TX | Compare Energy Rates
```

**Impact:**
- Poor SEO - duplicate state names
- Unprofessional appearance
- Suggests data mapping issues

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue 3: Missing ZIP Lookup Forms

**Problem:** Houston destination page has no ZIP code input forms.

**Evidence:**
```
Total forms found: 0
Total inputs found: 0
Elements with ZIP-related placeholders: 0
```

**Impact:**
- Users cannot search for different ZIP codes once on city pages
- Poor user experience for ZIP code refinement
- No secondary lookup functionality

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue 4: JavaScript Execution Failure

**Problem:** Multiple JavaScript files fail to load due to CSP violations.

**Evidence:**
```
- page.BLtQikpa.js - BLOCKED
- FacetedPlanGrid.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.JRx8lozq.js - BLOCKED  
- zip-lookup.js - BLOCKED
- Inline scripts - BLOCKED
```

**Impact:**
- Plan comparison features don't work
- Interactive filtering is broken
- Form submissions fail silently

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: CSP Configuration

The Content Security Policy is too restrictive for the current JavaScript architecture:

1. **Nonce Mismatch**: Scripts expect nonces but don't receive them
2. **Asset Path Issues**: Bundled assets aren't whitelisted properly
3. **Inline Script Blocking**: Critical initialization code is blocked

### Secondary Issue: Missing Houston Page Forms

The city-specific pages (like Houston) don't include ZIP lookup forms, creating dead-ends for users.

## Immediate Action Required

### 1. Fix Content Security Policy (HIGH PRIORITY)

**File to modify:** `astro.config.mjs` or server configuration

**Solution Options:**
- Add proper nonce injection for all scripts
- Whitelist critical script paths in CSP
- Use hash-based CSP for static scripts
- Temporarily relax CSP for testing

### 2. Fix Page Title Duplication (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Likely files:**
- `/src/pages/texas/[city].astro`
- SEO metadata generation functions

**Solution:** Remove duplicate state name in title generation

### 3. Add ZIP Lookup to City Pages (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Files to modify:**
- Houston page template
- Other city page templates

**Solution:** Include ZIP lookup form component on all city pages

### 4. Test Script Loading (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Solution:** Verify all JavaScript loads correctly after CSP fixes

## Test Evidence

### Screenshots Captured:
- `01_homepage_loaded.png` - Homepage works correctly
- `02_zip_entered.png` - ZIP entry successful
- `03_after_submit.png` - Redirect successful  
- `houston_page_full.png` - Houston page showing issues

### API Response:
- ZIP lookup API returns 302 redirect (normal)
- Successful redirect to `/texas/houston-tx?zip=77002`
- Page loads but JavaScript fails

### Console Errors:
- 17 console errors captured
- All related to CSP violations
- No JavaScript functionality working

## Verification Steps

1. **Fix CSP**: Verify JavaScript loads without errors
2. **Test ZIP Lookup**: Ensure form submission works end-to-end  
3. **Check Page Titles**: Verify no "TX, TX" duplications
4. **Add City Page Forms**: Test secondary ZIP lookups work

## Business Impact

- **User Experience**: Severely degraded due to broken JavaScript
- **SEO**: Page title duplication hurts search rankings
- **Conversion**: Users cannot easily navigate between cities
- **Functionality**: Core features are completely non-functional

## Conclusion

The Houston ZIP code test successfully identified the root causes of the reported issues. The primary problem is a Content Security Policy that blocks all JavaScript execution, making the site largely non-interactive. This requires immediate attention to restore functionality.

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix CSP configuration (blocks all interactivity)
2. Restore JavaScript functionality  
3. Fix page title duplication
4. Add ZIP lookup forms to city pages

All issues are fixable but require backend configuration changes for the CSP problem.
