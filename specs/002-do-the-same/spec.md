# Feature Specification: Address Search API Validation System

**Feature Branch**: `002-do-the-same`  
**Created**: September 6, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "do the same validation for address search api"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a Texas electricity customer searches for their service address to find available plans, the system validates their complete address input (street address + ZIP code) to ensure it's within Texas's deregulated electricity market, provides accurate TDSP territory identification, and returns reliable ESIID (Electric Service Identifier ID) results before making external API calls.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user enters a complete Texas address with valid ZIP code, **When** they submit the address search, **Then** the system validates the address format and ZIP code before making ERCOT API calls
2. **Given** a user enters an incomplete address (missing street number), **When** they attempt to search, **Then** the system displays "Please enter a complete street address" error message
3. **Given** a user enters an address with an invalid Texas ZIP code, **When** they submit the search, **Then** the system displays "This ZIP code is outside Texas's deregulated electricity market" before making any API calls
4. **Given** a user enters an address in a regulated utility area (Austin Energy), **When** they submit the search, **Then** the system displays "This area has regulated electricity service - address search not available"
5. **Given** a user enters an address in a multi-TDSP ZIP code area, **When** the search is performed, **Then** the system provides TDSP boundary warnings and enhanced address validation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters a valid ZIP code but incomplete street address?
- How does system handle addresses with apartment/unit numbers in complex TDSP boundary areas?
- What feedback is provided for ZIP codes with no ESIID coverage in the ERCOT database?
- How does system handle rate limiting from ERCOT API after validation passes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate complete address format before making external ERCOT API calls
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate ZIP code using Texas boundary and deregulated market verification
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with existing TDSP mapping system to pre-validate service territories
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time address validation feedback during user input
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent API calls for known invalid address patterns (incomplete, non-Texas, regulated areas)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle multi-TDSP ZIP codes with enhanced validation warnings
- **FR-007**: System MUST log validation results for debugging and analytics
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve user input data when validation fails to allow corrections
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide actionable error messages specific to address validation failures
- **FR-010**: System MUST cache validation results to improve performance for repeated searches
- **FR-011**: System MUST rate limit client-side validation to prevent abuse
- **FR-012**: System MUST fallback gracefully when ERCOT API is unavailable after validation passes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Address Input**: Complete address including street number, street name, city, state, ZIP code, optional unit
- **ZIP Code Validation Result**: Format validity, Texas boundary status, deregulated market status, TDSP information
- **Address Validation Result**: Completeness check, format validation, normalization data, confidence score
- **TDSP Territory**: Service provider mapping, boundary type, address validation requirements
- **Validation Cache**: Cached results with TTL, validation timestamp, hit/miss statistics
- **API Request**: Pre-validated address data, ERCOT API parameters, rate limiting metadata
