# Feature Specification: Complete Texas Deregulated ZIP Code Coverage

**Feature Branch**: `007-hundreds-of-deregulated`  
**Created**: September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "hundreds of deregulated Texas cities cannot use ZIP code navigation - they get not found in service area errors even though electricity choice IS available in their area. fix it. test it make sure 100% coverage exists. use online sources or whatever sources you need to use. The API etc. Superthink"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Any Texas customer in a deregulated electricity market should be able to enter their ZIP code and be instantly taken to a comprehensive list of available electricity plans for their specific service area, regardless of whether they live in a major metropolitan area or a small rural town.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer in Abilene, TX (deregulated AEP territory), **When** they enter ZIP code "79601", **Then** they are redirected to electricity plans for Abilene with accurate TDSP information
2. **Given** a customer in Beaumont, TX (deregulated TNMP territory), **When** they enter ZIP code "77701", **Then** they are redirected to electricity plans for Beaumont
3. **Given** a customer in Corpus Christi, TX (deregulated AEP Central territory), **When** they enter ZIP code "78401", **Then** they are redirected to electricity plans for Corpus Christi
4. **Given** a customer in any small deregulated town, **When** they enter their ZIP code, **Then** they are either redirected to their city's plans or to the nearest major city's plans with clear messaging
5. **Given** a customer in a municipal utility area like Austin, **When** they enter their ZIP code, **Then** they receive appropriate messaging about municipal utility service with contact information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a ZIP code spans multiple cities? System should route to the primary city or provide selection options
- How does system handle new ZIP codes not yet in database? System should provide fallback to nearest known service area
- What happens with ZIP codes in mixed regulated/deregulated areas? System should detect the specific service type for that address
- How does system handle ZIP codes in cooperative utility territories? System should provide appropriate co-op utility information

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST map 100% of Texas ZIP codes in deregulated electricity markets to their corresponding city electricity plan pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST accurately identify TDSP territory for every mapped ZIP code using authoritative utility territory data
- **FR-003**: System MUST distinguish between deregulated, regulated, municipal, and cooperative utility service areas
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide immediate ZIP code validation with response time under 200ms
- **FR-005**: System MUST redirect users to appropriate electricity plan comparison pages for deregulated areas
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide informational responses for non-deregulated areas with utility contact information
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate coverage completeness using authoritative sources (ERCOT, PUCT, utility company databases)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle ZIP code boundary changes and utility territory updates automatically
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide fallback routing to nearest service area when exact ZIP mapping is unavailable
- **FR-010**: System MUST log all ZIP code lookup attempts for coverage gap analysis
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain data accuracy through periodic validation against external authoritative sources
- **FR-012**: System MUST support ZIP+4 code resolution for precise service territory determination
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear error messaging for invalid or non-Texas ZIP codes
- **FR-014**: System MUST cache frequently accessed ZIP mappings for performance optimization

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: ZIP code lookup response time MUST be under 200ms for 95% of requests
- **PR-002**: System MUST handle 10,000+ concurrent ZIP lookups without degradation
- **PR-003**: Data refresh process MUST complete within 4 hours to maintain currency

### Data Quality Requirements
- **DQ-001**: ZIP code mappings MUST achieve 99.9% accuracy when validated against ERCOT service territory data
- **DQ-002**: System MUST identify and flag any gaps in ZIP code coverage within deregulated areas
- **DQ-003**: Data sources MUST be updated at least monthly to reflect utility territory changes

### Key Entities *(mandatory)*
- **ZIP Code**: 5-digit postal code with optional +4 extension, primary key for customer location identification
- **City**: Municipal area with defined electricity service territory, may have multiple ZIP codes
- **TDSP Territory**: Transmission and Distribution Service Provider coverage area, determines available electricity providers
- **Service Type**: Classification of electricity service (deregulated, municipal, cooperative, regulated) determining customer choice availability
- **Data Source**: External authoritative database (ERCOT, PUCT, utility companies) used for validation and mapping updates

## Data Sources & Validation Strategy

### Primary Authoritative Sources
1. **ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas)**: Official service territory boundaries and TDSP assignments
2. **PUCT (Public Utility Commission of Texas)**: Regulatory oversight data for deregulated areas
3. **Individual Utility Company APIs**: Direct territory data from Oncor, CenterPoint, AEP, TNMP
4. **USPS ZIP Code Database**: Authoritative postal code boundaries and updates
5. **Texas Government Geographic Data**: Municipal boundaries and utility service areas

### Coverage Validation Process
1. **Baseline Assessment**: Identify all Texas ZIP codes in deregulated electricity markets
2. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current mappings against comprehensive ZIP code lists
3. **Authority Validation**: Cross-reference mappings with official utility territory data
4. **Accuracy Testing**: Validate random sample of ZIP codes against known service territories
5. **Completeness Verification**: Ensure no deregulated ZIP codes return "not found" errors

### Success Metrics
- **100% Coverage**: All deregulated Texas ZIP codes successfully mapped to appropriate city plan pages
- **Zero False Negatives**: No "not found in service area" errors for valid deregulated ZIP codes
- **99.9% Accuracy**: ZIP-to-city-to-TDSP mappings verified against authoritative sources
- **<200ms Response Time**: Performance maintained across all ZIP code lookups
- **Monthly Updates**: Data currency maintained through regular validation cycles
