# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Texas Deregulated Area ZIP Code Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `010-expand-zip-code`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "expand zip code navigation beyond the 4 core metro areas to serve all non major metro areas that are deregulated in texas for 100% coverage of deregulated areas in texas"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants ZIP navigation expanded beyond Dallas/Houston/Fort Worth/Austin
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Texas residents in deregulated areas
   ‚Üí Actions: Enter ZIP code, find electricity plans
   ‚Üí Data: ZIP codes, cities, deregulated areas, TDU territories
   ‚Üí Constraints: 100% coverage of all deregulated Texas areas
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [ADDRESSED: All major deregulated areas identified through market analysis]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User enters ZIP from Tyler, Corpus Christi, Waco, etc.
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each deregulated city must have proper ZIP mapping
6. Identify Key Entities (ZIP codes, deregulated cities, TDU territories)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on user value, not implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Texas resident living in any deregulated electricity market area should be able to enter their ZIP code and be directed to electricity plans available in their specific city, not incorrectly routed to plans for a different city or receive an error message.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user in Tyler, Texas, **When** they enter ZIP code 75701, **Then** they should be directed to Tyler electricity plans page, not Dallas plans
2. **Given** a user in Corpus Christi, Texas, **When** they enter ZIP code 78401, **Then** they should be directed to Corpus Christi electricity plans page, not receive a "NOT_FOUND" error
3. **Given** a user in Waco, Texas, **When** they enter ZIP code 76701, **Then** they should be directed to Waco electricity plans page, not Fort Worth plans
4. **Given** a user in Laredo, Texas, **When** they enter ZIP code 78040, **Then** they should be directed to Laredo electricity plans page
5. **Given** a user in College Station, Texas, **When** they enter ZIP code 77840, **Then** they should be directed to College Station electricity plans page, not Houston plans
6. **Given** a user in Lubbock, Texas, **When** they enter ZIP code 79401, **Then** they should be directed to Lubbock electricity plans page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters a ZIP code from a rural area served by an electric cooperative?
- How does the system handle ZIP codes from areas that transitioned from regulated to deregulated markets?
- What occurs when a ZIP code spans multiple TDU territories?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST correctly map all deregulated Texas ZIP codes to their specific city electricity plans pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST distinguish between different deregulated cities instead of using overly broad regional mappings
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide accurate electricity plan access for Tyler/Longview area (East Texas)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide accurate electricity plan access for Corpus Christi/Laredo area (South Texas)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide accurate electricity plan access for Waco/Temple/Killeen area (Central Texas)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide accurate electricity plan access for College Station/Bryan area (Brazos Valley)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide accurate electricity plan access for Lubbock area (West Texas)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle Abilene and other AEP Texas North territory cities
- **FR-009**: System MUST correctly identify and handle rural electric cooperative areas with appropriate messaging
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain existing correct behavior for Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth, and Austin
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear error messages for truly non-deregulated areas
- **FR-012**: System MUST achieve 100% coverage of all Texas deregulated electricity markets

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: ZIP code validation and routing MUST complete within 500ms
- **PR-002**: System MUST handle concurrent ZIP code lookups from multiple users without degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Deregulated City**: Represents a Texas city with competitive electricity markets, has specific ZIP code ranges, belongs to a TDU territory
- **ZIP Code Mapping**: Links specific ZIP codes to their correct deregulated city, replaces overly broad range mappings
- **TDU Territory**: Transmission/Distribution Service Provider coverage area (Oncor, CenterPoint, AEP North/Central/South, TNMP)
- **Electric Cooperative Area**: Non-deregulated rural areas served by member-owned cooperatives, requires different user messaging

## Current State Analysis

### Working Correctly (Core 4 Metro Areas)
- Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex ‚Üí `/electricity-plans/dallas/` and `/electricity-plans/fort-worth/`
- Houston Metro ‚Üí `/electricity-plans/houston/`
- Austin ‚Üí `/texas/austin-tx/municipal-utility` (municipal utility)

### Critical Issues Identified
- **Overly Broad Ranges**: ZIP range 75000-75999 maps ALL to Dallas (includes Tyler, Longview, Paris, etc.)
- **Missing Coverage**: South Texas (78000-78199, 78300-78699) returns NOT_FOUND errors
- **Incorrect Routing**: Waco residents sent to Fort Worth plans instead of Waco plans
- **Market Gap**: Major deregulated cities like Corpus Christi completely unsupported

### Deregulated Areas Requiring Coverage
- **East Texas**: Tyler, Longview, Marshall, Paris, Texarkana
- **Central Texas**: Waco, Temple, Killeen, Round Rock
- **South Texas**: Corpus Christi, Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen, Victoria
- **Brazos Valley**: College Station, Bryan
- **West Texas**: Lubbock, Abilene, Midland, Odessa
