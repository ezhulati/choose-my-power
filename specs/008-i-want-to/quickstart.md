# Quickstart Guide: Advanced Plans Listing & Comparison

**Feature**: Advanced Texas Electricity Plans Listing & Comparison Page  
**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: Validate user journey scenarios and system integration

## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure development environment is running
npm run dev                    # Start development server on port 4324
npm run build:data:smart      # Generate plan data for testing (if needed)
npm run db:health             # Verify database connectivity

# Verify constitutional compliance
npm run validate:ids          # Must return ZERO hardcoded IDs
npm run security:audit        # Security verification
npm run lint                  # Code quality check
```

### Test Data Verification
```bash
# Verify real plan data is available
curl "http://localhost:4324/api/plans/city/dallas" | jq '.length'
# Should return 50+ plans

# Verify provider data
curl "http://localhost:4324/api/providers?state=texas" | jq '.length' 
# Should return 20+ providers

# Test service layer integration
node -e "
const { getPlansForCity } = require('./src/lib/services/provider-service.ts');
getPlansForCity('dallas', 'texas').then(plans => {
  console.log('Plans loaded:', plans.length);
  console.log('Sample plan ID:', plans[0]?.id);
  console.log('Constitutional compliance:', /^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$/.test(plans[0]?.id));
});
"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Issues
```bash
# If page load is slow
npm run perf:test                    # Identify bottlenecks
npm run build:data:smart             # Refresh plan data cache
npm run cache:stats                  # Check Redis cache status

# If filters are slow
redis-cli FLUSHALL                   # Clear Redis cache if needed
npm run db:optimize                  # Optimize database indexes
```

### Data Issues
```bash
# If plans are missing or outdated
npm run build:data:fresh             # Force fresh data generation
npm run db:health                    # Check database connectivity
npm run validate:plan-data           # Verify data integrity
```

### Constitutional Violations
```bash
# If hardcoded IDs detected
npm run validate:ids                 # Find violations
grep -r "68b[0-9a-f]\{21\}" src/    # Manual search for hardcoded IDs

# If mock data is used
grep -r "mockData" src/              # Find mock data imports
grep -r "mock" src/lib/services/     # Check service layer
```

## Ready for Task Generation
