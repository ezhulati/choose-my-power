# Tasks: Advanced Texas Electricity Plans Listing & Comparison Page

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓, quickstart.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extracted: Astro/React/TypeScript, existing web app structure
2. Load optional design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: 4 entities → model/interface tasks
   → contracts/: 4 endpoints → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Service layer decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: 4 user scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category ✓:
   → Setup: React components, TypeScript interfaces
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, component tests
   → Core: filtering libraries, comparison engine, UI components
   → Integration: service layer, analytics, performance optimization
   → Polish: accessibility, responsive design, E2E tests
4. Apply task rules ✓:
   → Different files = marked [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD compliance)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✓
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness ✓:
   → All 4 contracts have tests ✓
   → All 4 entities have interfaces ✓
   → All endpoints implemented ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

**Setup Dependencies:**
- T001-T005 must complete before any other tasks
- T006-T010 (interfaces) must complete before components and tests

**TDD Dependencies (CRITICAL):**
- T011-T014 (contract tests) MUST complete before T030-T033 (API implementation)
- T015-T019 (component tests) MUST complete before T025-T029 (component implementation)

**Implementation Dependencies:**

- Integration tests before performance optimization (T050-T053)
- Performance optimization before E2E validation (T054-T058)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2: TypeScript Interfaces (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T006-T010 together - different files, no dependencies:
Task: "ElectricityPlan interface in src/lib/types/electricity-plan.ts"
Task: "PlanFilter interface in src/lib/types/plan-filter.ts"
Task: "ComparisonState interface in src/lib/types/comparison-state.ts"
Task: "UserPreferences interface in src/lib/types/user-preferences.ts"
Task: "API response types in src/lib/types/api-types.ts"
```

### Phase 3.3: Contract Tests (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T011-T014 together - different test files:
Task: "Contract test GET /api/plans/list in tests/contract/plans-list-api.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/plans/compare in tests/contract/plans-compare-api.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/plans/suggestions in tests/contract/plans-suggestions-api.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /analytics/filter-interaction in tests/contract/analytics-api.test.ts"
```

### Phase 3.4: Component Tests (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T015-T019 together - different component test files:
Task: "PlansListingPage component test in tests/components/plans-listing-page.test.tsx"
Task: "PlansFilter component test in tests/components/plans-filter.test.tsx"
Task: "PlansGrid component test in tests/components/plans-grid.test.tsx"
Task: "PlansComparison component test in tests/components/plans-comparison.test.tsx"
Task: "PlanCard component test in tests/components/plan-card.test.tsx"
```

### Phase 3.5: Core Libraries (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T020-T024 together - different library files:
Task: "Filter logic engine in src/lib/plan-filtering/filter-engine.ts"
Task: "Filter URL state management in src/lib/plan-filtering/url-state.ts"
Task: "Comparison selection logic in src/lib/plan-comparison/comparison-state.ts"
Task: "Cost analysis calculations in src/lib/plan-comparison/cost-analysis.ts"
Task: "Feature comparison matrix in src/lib/plan-comparison/feature-matrix.ts"
```

## Constitutional Compliance Checks

**Critical Validations (Built into tasks):**
- [ ] **T053**: Validate no hardcoded plan IDs using `npm run validate:ids`
- [ ] **T034**: Ensure service layer integration uses real data services only
- [ ] **T051**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance verification
- [ ] **T050**: Performance requirements (<300ms filters, <2s page load)
- [ ] **T044**: Texas Design System color scheme and component consistency

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **TDD Compliance**: ALL tests must be written and failing before implementation
- **Constitutional Requirements**: No hardcoded plan IDs, real data services only
- **Performance Gates**: <300ms filter operations, 90+ PageSpeed scores
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout all components

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: 4 contract files → 4 contract test tasks [P] (T011-T014)
2. **From Data Model**: 4 entities → 5 interface tasks [P] (T006-T010)
3. **From Components**: 5 components → 5 component tests [P] + 5 implementations
4. **From User Stories**: 4 scenarios → 4 integration tests [P] (T046-T049)
5. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Libraries → Components → APIs → Pages → Polish
6. **Dependencies**: Tests before implementation, models before services

## Validation Checklist ✅

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T011-T014 for 4 endpoints)
- [x] All entities have interface tasks (T006-T010 for 5 type files)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.3-3.4 before 3.5-3.7)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Total Tasks**: 58 tasks organized in 13 phases with proper TDD ordering and parallel execution opportunities.
