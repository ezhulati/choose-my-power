## Summary
Create a comprehensive electricity plans listing and comparison page for Texas customers with advanced filtering capabilities, side-by-side plan comparison, and real-time search functionality. The solution will integrate with the existing ChooseMyPower platform using established service layer patterns, constitutional data requirements (no hardcoded plan IDs/ESIDs), and the Texas Design System for authentic Texas electricity market branding.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Astro 5 and React 18  
**Primary Dependencies**: Astro 5, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, Redis (ioredis)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with JSON fallback from generated data files  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E testing  
**Target Platform**: Web application (mobile-first responsive design)
**Project Type**: web - Astro SSG/SSR with React component integration  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <300ms filter operations, 90+ PageSpeed scores  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, Texas electricity market compliance, 50+ concurrent plan comparisons  
**Scale/Scope**: 50+ plans per service area, 881+ Texas cities, real-time filtering and comparison

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (plans listing page as Astro page with React components)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Astro + React, no wrapper abstractions)

- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct service layer usage, no unnecessary abstractions)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Planned (filtering logic, comparison engine, state management)
- Libraries listed: 
  - plan-filtering-lib (filter logic and state)
  - plan-comparison-lib (side-by-side comparison)
  - plan-display-lib (cards, lists, responsive layouts)
- CLI per library: N/A (web components, not CLI tools)
- Library docs: Components will follow existing doc patterns in `/src/components/`

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

**Structure Decision**: Astro web application - integrate new plans listing functionality into existing Astro/React architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Areas Completed:
1. **Existing Plans Data Structure**: Analyzed current service layer (`provider-service.ts`, `city-service.ts`)
   - Decision: Use existing `getPlansForCity()` and `getProviders()` services
   - Rationale: Maintains constitutional compliance with real data architecture
   - Alternatives considered: Direct API calls (rejected - bypasses service layer)

2. **Filtering Architecture**: Reviewed existing faceted navigation system
   - Decision: Extend existing faceted navigation patterns from `src/lib/faceted/`
   - Rationale: Consistent with current URL-based state management for SEO
   - Alternatives considered: New filter system (rejected - duplicates working system)

3. **Comparison Functionality**: Analyzed existing comparison patterns
   - Decision: Create new comparison library with session state management
   - Rationale: No existing side-by-side plan comparison functionality
   - Alternatives considered: Extend ProductDetailsPage (rejected - different use case)

4. **Performance Optimization**: Reviewed current caching and optimization
   - Decision: Leverage existing Redis caching with plan-specific cache keys
   - Rationale: Maintains sub-300ms filter operation requirement
   - Alternatives considered: Client-side only filtering (rejected - SEO impact)

5. **Design System Integration**: Analyzed Texas Design System implementation
   - Decision: Use existing design tokens and component patterns
   - Rationale: Consistent branding and accessibility compliance
   - Alternatives considered: Custom components (rejected - maintains consistency)

**Output**: All research areas resolved, no NEEDS CLARIFICATION remaining

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model (data-model.md generated ✓)
Core entities identified from specification requirements:
- **ElectricityPlan**: Extended from existing plan service data
- **PlanFilter**: Filter state management with URL persistence
- **ComparisonState**: Session-based comparison selections
- **UserPreferences**: Filter preferences and session state

### API Contracts (contracts/ generated ✓)
Contract endpoints designed from functional requirements:
- `GET /api/plans/list` - Get filtered plans for service area
- `GET /api/plans/compare` - Get detailed comparison data
- `POST /api/analytics/filter-interaction` - Track user filter usage
- `GET /api/plans/suggestions` - Smart filter suggestions for zero results

### Testing Contracts (contract tests generated ✓)
Failing contract tests created for TDD compliance:
- Plan list filtering validation
- Comparison data structure tests
- Analytics tracking verification
- Filter suggestion algorithm tests

### Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md generated ✓)
User journey validation scenarios:
1. Load plans listing page with 50+ plans
2. Apply multiple filters and verify real-time updates
3. Select plans for side-by-side comparison
4. Complete plan selection with proper ID resolution

**Output**: Complete design artifacts with constitutional compliance verified

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate from Phase 1 contracts and data model
- Each API contract → failing contract test task [P]
- Each React component → component test task [P]
- Each user journey → integration test task
- Implementation tasks ordered by dependency graph

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD-first: All tests before implementation
- Service layer → UI components → page integration
- Parallel execution: Independent components marked [P]
- Critical path: Core filtering → comparison → responsive design

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks

**Priority Breakdown**:
1. Contract tests (4 tasks) [P]
2. Service integration tests (3 tasks) [P]  
3. Core filtering implementation (6 tasks)
4. Comparison functionality (5 tasks)
5. Responsive design (4 tasks)
6. Performance optimization (3 tasks)
7. E2E user journey validation (4 tasks)
8. Accessibility compliance (3 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - this table remains empty*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None      | N/A        | N/A                                 |
