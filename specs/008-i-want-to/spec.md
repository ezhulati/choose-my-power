## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Texas electricity customer visits the ChooseMyPower plans listing page to find the best electricity plan for their needs. They start with 50+ available plans in their area, use modern filtering tools to narrow down options by their specific preferences (contract length, rate type, green energy, etc.), compare the top candidates side-by-side, and confidently select the single best plan that meets their criteria.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the plans listing page, **When** they view the initial page load, **Then** they see all available plans for their area (50+ plans) with clear pricing, provider names, and key features displayed in an organized grid/list view

2. **Given** the user sees multiple plan options, **When** they apply filters (contract length, rate type, price range, provider, green energy options), **Then** the plan list updates in real-time to show only matching plans with filter count indicators

3. **Given** the user has filtered down to 5-10 relevant plans, **When** they select plans to compare side-by-side, **Then** a comparison view displays detailed plan features, pricing structures, and key differentiators in an easy-to-read format

4. **Given** the user is comparing plans, **When** they identify their preferred option, **Then** they can immediately proceed to plan selection with clear pricing and next steps

5. **Given** the user accesses the page on mobile, tablet, or desktop, **When** they interact with filters and comparisons, **Then** all functionality works smoothly with appropriate touch targets and responsive layouts

6. **Given** the user applies multiple complex filters, **When** no plans match their criteria, **Then** they see helpful suggestions to adjust filters with smart recommendations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when plan data is loading or temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle users with no available plans in their service area?
- What occurs if comparison features fail to load properly?
- How are price changes or plan discontinuations handled during user session?
- What happens when filters eliminate all plan options?
