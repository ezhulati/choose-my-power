# Feature Specification: Address ESID Validation for Plan Selection

**Feature Branch**: `004-when-user-selects`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "when user selects plan they will enter their address and hit the address esid api to find the address esid and validate the address"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ PARSED: User flow for address validation after plan selection
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ IDENTIFIED: actors (user), actions (select plan, enter address, validate), data (address, ESID)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ESID API provider not specified - ERCOT, third-party?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Address format requirements not specified]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Validation failure behavior not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Address, ESID, Plan Selection entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN: Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A customer shopping for electricity plans wants to select a specific plan. After choosing their preferred plan, they need to provide their service address so the system can validate that the plan is actually available at their location and retrieve their unique ESID (Electric Service Identifier) for enrollment purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected an electricity plan, **When** they enter a valid Texas service address, **Then** the system validates the address and retrieves the corresponding ESID
2. **Given** a user enters their address, **When** the address validation completes successfully, **Then** the system confirms plan availability at that location and proceeds to enrollment
3. **Given** a user enters an invalid or incomplete address, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the system provides clear error messaging and address correction suggestions
4. **Given** a user enters an address outside the selected plan's service territory, **When** validation completes, **Then** the system explains the service area limitation and suggests alternative plans

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the address is valid but no ESID is found?
- How does the system handle addresses that exist but are not serviceable for electricity?
- What occurs when the ESID API is temporarily unavailable?
- How are multi-unit addresses (apartments, condos) handled for ESID lookup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to enter their complete service address after selecting an electricity plan
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate the entered address format and completeness before processing
- **FR-003**: System MUST retrieve the unique ESID associated with the validated service address
- **FR-004**: System MUST confirm that the selected plan is available at the customer's service location
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid, incomplete, or unserviceable addresses
- **FR-006**: System MUST suggest address corrections when the entered address is close to a valid address
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle multi-unit addresses by allowing unit/apartment number specification
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to modify their address if validation fails or returns incorrect results
- **FR-009**: System MUST log address validation attempts for customer support and fraud prevention purposes

*Marked unclear requirements:*
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ESID API provider not specified - ERCOT, utility company, or third-party service?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate addresses using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: address validation service not specified - USPS, commercial geocoding service?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle validation failures by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback behavior not specified - retry, manual review, customer service escalation?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST store address and ESID data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention period and purpose not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Service Address**: Complete physical address where electricity service is provided, including street address, city, state, ZIP code, and optional unit number
- **ESID (Electric Service Identifier)**: Unique 17-digit identifier assigned to each electric meter/service point by ERCOT, used for plan enrollment and service switching
- **Plan Selection**: User's chosen electricity plan that must be validated for availability at their service address
- **Address Validation Result**: System response containing validation status, corrected address suggestions, ESID information, and plan availability confirmation
