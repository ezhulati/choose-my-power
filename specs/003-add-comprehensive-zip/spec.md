# Feature Specification: Add Comprehensive ZIP Code Lookup Forms to City Pages

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-comprehensive-zip`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add comprehensive ZIP code lookup forms to all city pages for better user experience"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential electricity customer visits a city page (e.g., Dallas, Houston) to research electricity plans for their specific address. They need to enter their ZIP code to see plans available in their exact service territory, as electricity plan availability varies by ZIP code within the same city due to different utility service areas (TDSPs).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on any city page, **When** they see the ZIP code lookup form, **Then** they can immediately enter their ZIP code without navigating away
2. **Given** a user enters a valid ZIP code for that city, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they are directed to filtered electricity plans specific to their ZIP code area
3. **Given** a user enters an invalid ZIP code, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they receive a clear error message with suggestions for valid ZIP codes in that city
4. **Given** a user enters a ZIP code from a different city, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they are redirected to the correct city page for that ZIP code
5. **Given** a user is on mobile device, **When** they interact with the ZIP code form, **Then** the form is easily accessible and usable on their screen size

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters partial ZIP codes (less than 5 digits)?
- How does system handle ZIP codes that span multiple cities or utility territories?
- What happens when user enters ZIP codes not served by any electricity providers?
- How does system handle ZIP codes that are valid but outside of Texas?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a ZIP code lookup form on every city page in Texas
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that entered ZIP codes are in proper 5-digit format
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify that entered ZIP codes correspond to electricity service territories in Texas
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to submit ZIP code and be redirected to relevant electricity plan results
- **FR-005**: System MUST display helpful error messages for invalid ZIP code entries
- **FR-006**: System MUST redirect users to correct city page when they enter ZIP code for different city
- **FR-007**: System MUST filter electricity plans based on ZIP code's utility service territory (TDSP)
- **FR-008**: Forms MUST be responsive and optimized for mobile devices
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide autocomplete or suggestions for valid ZIP codes within the city [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should system show dropdown of valid ZIP codes for the city?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST track ZIP code lookup interactions for analytics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific analytics data should be captured?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle ZIP codes that span multiple utility territories [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should system show all available plans or prompt user for more specific address?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ZIP Code**: 5-digit postal code, associated with specific utility territory (TDSP), belongs to one or more cities
- **City Page**: Individual page for Texas cities, contains electricity plan information, must display ZIP lookup form
- **Utility Territory (TDSP)**: Transmission/Distribution Service Provider area that determines electricity plan availability
- **Electricity Plan**: Available energy plans that vary by utility territory and ZIP code
- **Form Submission**: User interaction capturing ZIP code input, timestamp, source city page, validation results
