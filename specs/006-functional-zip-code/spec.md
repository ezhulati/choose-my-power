# Feature Specification: Functional ZIP Code to City Plans Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `006-functional-zip-code`  
**Created**: January 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Functional ZIP code entry that redirects users directly to city-specific plans list with real TDSP/TDU data and rates. Clean UX: enter ZIP ‚Üí click button ‚Üí navigate to correct city plans page with full render (no intermediate pages or partial loads). Fix current issues: wrong /texas redirect, intermediate error pages, and partial rendering."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Feature clearly defined: ZIP code navigation improvement
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: Users seeking electricity plans
   ‚Üí Actions: Enter ZIP, click button, navigate to city plans
   ‚Üí Data: ZIP codes, city mapping, TDSP/TDU territories, electricity plans
   ‚Üí Constraints: No intermediate pages, full rendering, real data only
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úì
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly specified in user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Clear user flow provided
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí ZIP codes, cities, TDSP territories, electricity plans
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
   ‚Üí No technical implementation details
   ‚Üí Focus on user experience and business value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential electricity customer visits the site and wants to quickly find available electricity plans for their specific location. They enter their ZIP code into a simple form, click a button, and are immediately taken to a comprehensive list of real electricity plans available in their city with current rates from their local TDSP/TDU provider.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on a page with ZIP code entry, **When** they enter a valid Texas ZIP code (e.g., "75201") and click the submit button, **Then** they are redirected to the city-specific plans page (e.g., `/electricity-plans/dallas-tx/`) with full page load and real plan data
2. **Given** a user enters a valid ZIP code, **When** the page loads, **Then** all electricity plans displayed must be real data from the correct TDSP/TDU territory with current rates (no mock or placeholder data)
3. **Given** a user clicks the submit button, **When** navigation occurs, **Then** there must be no intermediate loading pages or error pages between ZIP entry and final plans display
4. **Given** a user is redirected to the city plans page, **When** the page renders, **Then** it must fully load all content without partial rendering or progressive loading states visible to the user

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters an invalid ZIP code? System must provide clear error message without navigation
- What happens when a ZIP code is valid but not in Texas deregulated market? System must inform user and provide alternatives
- What happens when a ZIP code maps to multiple cities? System must select the primary city for that ZIP code
- How does system handle ZIP codes that are valid but have no available electricity plans? System must display appropriate "no plans available" message

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate ZIP code input and only accept valid 5-digit US ZIP codes
- **FR-002**: System MUST map valid ZIP codes to their corresponding Texas cities using real geographic data
- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect users directly to the city-specific plans URL (format: `/electricity-plans/{city-slug}-tx/`) without intermediate pages
- **FR-004**: System MUST display only real electricity plans with current rates from the correct TDSP/TDU territory for the ZIP code location
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure full page rendering with no partial loading states visible to end users
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle invalid ZIP codes with clear error messaging without triggering navigation
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide smooth user experience with no broken redirects or 404 errors during ZIP-to-city navigation
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure ZIP code button remains inactive until valid ZIP code is entered (no action on empty or invalid input)

### Key Entities
- **ZIP Code**: 5-digit postal code that maps to specific Texas cities and TDSP territories
- **Texas City**: Municipal area with electricity deregulation, contains multiple ZIP codes, has specific URL slug format
- **TDSP Territory**: Transmission and Distribution Service Provider service area that determines plan availability
- **Electricity Plan**: Real rate plan with current pricing from providers serving the TDSP territory
- **City Plans Page**: Destination URL showing comprehensive list of available electricity plans for specific city
