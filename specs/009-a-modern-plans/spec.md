# Feature Specification: Modern Plans Listing Page Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `009-a-modern-plans`  
**Created**: September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a modern plans listing page for plans. Im not sure this was ever implemented from earlier."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Analysis: User wants modern plans listing page with uncertainty about existing implementation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: modern design, plans listing, possibly missing/incomplete feature
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Definition of "modern" - specific UI/UX requirements needed]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance expectations beyond current implementation]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Browse plans ‚Üí Filter options ‚Üí Compare plans ‚Üí Select plan
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Focus on modern design patterns and enhanced user experience
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ElectricityPlan, PlanFilter, ComparisonState entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding 'modern' requirements"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need for modern plan browsing experience and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A Texas homeowner visits the ChooseMyPower website to find electricity plans for their home. They want to easily browse available plans, filter by their preferences, compare options side-by-side, and select the best plan for their needs. The experience should be modern, fast, and intuitive on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the plans listing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see all available electricity plans displayed in a clean, organized grid within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a user wants to narrow their options, **When** they apply filters (contract length, rate type, provider, etc.), **Then** the results update immediately without page refresh
3. **Given** a user finds interesting plans, **When** they select plans for comparison, **Then** they can compare up to 4 plans side-by-side with detailed information
4. **Given** a user decides on a plan, **When** they click to select it, **Then** they are guided through the signup/order process
5. **Given** a user is on mobile, **When** they browse plans, **Then** the interface adapts seamlessly for touch interaction and smaller screens

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no plans are available for a specific area?
- How does the system handle slow network connections while loading plan data?
- What happens when a user tries to compare more than the maximum allowed plans?
- How does the interface handle very long plan names or provider names?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display electricity plans in an organized grid layout with clear visual hierarchy
- **FR-002**: System MUST load and display all available plans within 2 seconds for optimal user experience
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to filter plans by contract length, rate type, provider, price range, and green energy percentage
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time filtering without page reloads for smooth interaction
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to select up to 4 plans for side-by-side comparison
- **FR-006**: System MUST display comparison view with detailed plan information, costs, and features
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to proceed to plan selection/signup from the comparison view
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop experiences
- **FR-009**: System MUST display estimated monthly costs based on user's selected usage amount
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to sort plans by price, rating, contract length, and green energy percentage
- **FR-011**: System MUST show clear error messages when plan data cannot be loaded
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide retry functionality when initial plan loading fails
- **FR-013**: System MUST track user interactions for analytics and optimization purposes
- **FR-014**: System MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for inclusive access
- **FR-015**: System MUST only display plans with valid, dynamically-resolved identifiers (no hardcoded values)

*Areas needing clarification:*
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement modern design patterns [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific modern design elements - card shadows, animations, color schemes, typography?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide enhanced user experience features [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific enhancements beyond current filtering/comparison?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST optimize performance for modern expectations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance metrics beyond 2-second load time?]

### Key Entities
- **ElectricityPlan**: Represents an electricity plan with rate, contract terms, provider, features, and cost calculations
- **PlanFilter**: Defines user filtering criteria including location, contract preferences, rate types, and feature requirements  
- **ComparisonState**: Manages selected plans for side-by-side comparison with selection limits and comparison logic
- **AnalyticsEvent**: Captures user interactions and filtering behaviors for optimization insights
