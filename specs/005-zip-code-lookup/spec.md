# Feature Specification: ZIP Code Lookup Form Integration

**Feature Branch**: `005-zip-code-lookup`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ZIP code lookup form integration with existing address validation system"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves integrating ZIP code lookup with existing address validation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users seeking electricity plans
   ‚Üí Actions: enter ZIP code, validate location, proceed to plan selection
   ‚Üí Data: ZIP codes, service territories, address validation results
   ‚Üí Constraints: must integrate with existing address validation system
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific user flow after ZIP entry]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback behavior when ZIP validation fails]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: ZIP entry ‚Üí validation ‚Üí plan availability
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ZIP validation, territory mapping, integration requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ZIP codes, service territories, validation results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding error handling and user flow"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users visiting the ChooseMyPower platform need a quick way to check electricity plan availability by entering their ZIP code before proceeding with full address entry. This provides immediate feedback on service availability and streamlines the plan selection process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits a city page or plan comparison page, **When** they enter a valid Texas ZIP code, **Then** the system validates the ZIP code and displays available plans or confirms service territory
2. **Given** a user enters a valid ZIP code, **When** the validation completes successfully, **Then** the system integrates seamlessly with the existing address validation system for full address entry
3. **Given** a user enters an invalid or out-of-service ZIP code, **When** the validation fails, **Then** the system displays appropriate error messaging and suggests alternative ZIP codes or service areas

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters a ZIP code outside of Texas or ERCOT territory?
- How does the system handle ZIP codes with multiple TDSP service territories?
- What occurs if the ZIP validation service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system behave with partial ZIP code entries (less than 5 digits)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate ZIP codes for Texas electricity service territory coverage
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with existing address validation system without disrupting current functionality
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to enter ZIP codes through an intuitive form interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide immediate feedback on ZIP code validity and service availability
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle ZIP codes that span multiple TDSP territories appropriately
- **FR-006**: System MUST display error messages for invalid or out-of-service ZIP codes
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve user input when transitioning from ZIP lookup to full address validation
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific behavior when ZIP validation succeeds - redirect to plans, show preview, or proceed to address entry?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: caching strategy for ZIP validation results not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: analytics tracking requirements for ZIP lookup interactions not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ZIP Code**: 5-digit postal code representing service location, validation status, associated TDSP territory
- **Service Territory**: Geographic region served by specific TDSP, determines plan availability and service options
- **Validation Result**: Status of ZIP code lookup including success/failure state, territory assignment, error messaging
