# Research: ZIP Code Lookup Form Integration

**Branch**: `005-zip-code-lookup` | **Date**: 2025-09-06

## Research Summary
This feature integrates with existing, well-established ZIP validation infrastructure. All technical questions have been resolved through codebase analysis.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Reuse Existing ZIP Validation Infrastructure
**Rationale**: The codebase already contains comprehensive ZIP validation types (`ZIPValidationResult`), services (`zip-validation-service.ts`), and API endpoints (`/api/zip/*`). No new infrastructure needed.
**Alternatives considered**: Creating new validation system was rejected due to code duplication and inconsistency risk.

### Decision: Integrate with AddressSearchModal Component
**Rationale**: The existing `AddressSearchModal.tsx` component already handles address validation and ESID lookup. Integration preserves user experience continuity.
**Alternatives considered**: Creating separate flow was rejected due to UX fragmentation and duplicate functionality.

### Decision: Extend Existing Analytics Framework
**Rationale**: The `FormInteraction` and `AnalyticsService` patterns already track ZIP form interactions. Consistent with existing observability.
**Alternatives considered**: Custom analytics implementation rejected due to data fragmentation and maintenance overhead.

### Decision: Follow Existing Performance Patterns
**Rationale**: The <200ms ZIP validation and <500ms total flow requirements align with existing address validation performance targets.
**Alternatives considered**: Different performance targets rejected to maintain consistent user experience.

## Architecture Validation
All constitutional requirements are met through existing patterns:
- **Testing**: Existing Vitest/Playwright framework supports contract→integration→E2E→unit testing order
- **Data Models**: Reusing `ZIPValidationResult` and related types prevents DTO proliferation
- **Observability**: Existing `FormInteraction` analytics provide structured logging and error tracking
- **Performance**: Existing caching (Redis) and validation patterns meet performance requirements

## Integration Points Identified
1. **Frontend Integration**: ZIP lookup form → `AddressSearchModal` component handoff
2. **API Integration**: Existing `/api/zip/validate` endpoint for ZIP validation
3. **Analytics Integration**: Existing `trackFormInteraction` for usage analytics
4. **Caching Integration**: Existing Redis caching for validation results

## Research Conclusion
✅ **Phase 0 Complete**: No unknowns remain. All integration points and patterns are well-established in the existing codebase. Ready for Phase 1 design.
