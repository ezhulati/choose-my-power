# Feature Specification: ZIP Code Validation for Address Search Modal

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-zip-code`  
**Created**: September 6, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add ZIP code validation to address search modal"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a Texas electricity customer wants to find available plans for their location, they enter their address in the address search modal. The system validates their ZIP code to ensure it's within Texas's deregulated electricity market and provides immediate feedback on service area eligibility.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the address search modal, **When** they enter a valid Texas ZIP code (e.g., 75201 Dallas), **Then** the system accepts the input and allows them to proceed with plan searches
2. **Given** a user enters an invalid ZIP code format (e.g., "1234" or "abcde"), **When** they attempt to proceed, **Then** the system displays an error message "Please enter a valid 5-digit ZIP code"
3. **Given** a user enters a non-Texas ZIP code (e.g., 90210 California), **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system displays "This ZIP code is outside Texas's deregulated electricity market"
4. **Given** a user enters a regulated Texas ZIP code (e.g., municipal utility area), **When** they submit, **Then** the system shows "This area has regulated electricity service - plan comparison not available"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters a ZIP code that's partially deregulated (mixed TDSP territory)?
- How does system handle ZIP codes that recently changed regulatory status?
- What feedback is provided for ZIP codes with no electricity service data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate ZIP code format as exactly 5 digits
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify ZIP code exists within Texas state boundaries
- **FR-003**: System MUST check if ZIP code is within deregulated electricity market areas
- **FR-004**: System MUST display appropriate error messages for invalid ZIP codes
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to correct invalid ZIP code entries without losing other form data
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with existing TDSP (transmission/distribution service provider) mapping system
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time validation feedback (no form submission required)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle cases where ZIP code maps to multiple TDSPs

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ZIP Code**: 5-digit postal code, validation status, Texas boundary check, deregulation status
- **TDSP Territory**: Geographic service area mapping, regulatory status (deregulated/regulated), associated utility companies
- **Validation Result**: Success/failure status, error message, recommended user actions
