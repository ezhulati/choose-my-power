          content: `Green energy plans in Texas come in several varieties, each with different levels of renewable energy content:

**100% Renewable Plans** source all your electricity from renewable energy sources like wind and solar. These plans typically use Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to match your usage with renewable generation.

**Partial Renewable Plans** might be 50%, 75%, or other percentages renewable. These plans mix renewable and traditional energy sources.

**Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Plans** purchase RECs to offset traditional energy usage. The electricity delivered to your home comes from the general grid mix, but your usage is matched with renewable generation elsewhere.

**Direct Renewable Plans** source electricity directly from specific renewable energy projects, though this is less common in the retail market.`,

          content: `Green energy plans in Texas are more affordable than ever, with many 100% renewable plans priced competitively with traditional electricity plans. The cost premium for green energy has decreased significantly as renewable energy costs have fallen.

When evaluating green energy plan costs, consider both the direct financial impact and the environmental value you receive. Many consumers find the peace of mind and environmental benefits worth a small premium.

Some green energy plans also include additional benefits like energy efficiency programs, smart home technology, or carbon offset programs that add value beyond just renewable energy sourcing.`,
