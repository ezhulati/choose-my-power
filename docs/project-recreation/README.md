## Critical Requirements (Must Implement)

### **Constitutional Requirements**
These requirements are **mandatory** to prevent wrong plan orders and service failures:

#### **Plan ID Integrity**
- ❌ **NEVER hardcode plan IDs** - causes wrong plan orders
- ✅ **Dynamic MongoDB ObjectId resolution** via `/api/plans/search`
- ✅ **Automated validation** preventing hardcoded patterns
- ✅ **Database-first architecture** with JSON fallbacks

#### **ESID Accuracy**
- ❌ **NEVER hardcode ESIDs** - causes service connection failures  
- ✅ **Address-based ESID generation** via ERCOT APIs
- ✅ **ZIP code pattern analysis** for TDSP territory mapping
- ✅ **USPS address validation** for accuracy

#### **Real Data Only**
- ❌ **NEVER use mock data** - causes production inconsistencies
- ✅ **PostgreSQL database** as primary data source
- ✅ **Generated JSON files** (881 cities) as fallback
- ✅ **ComparePower API integration** for real-time data

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Page Load**: <3 seconds for plan comparison pages
- **API Response**: <500ms for plan searches, <200ms for ZIP validation
- **Build Performance**: <30s cached builds, <8min fresh builds
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1

### **Quality Gates**
- **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage required
- **Constitutional Tests**: Zero tolerance for plan ID/ESID violations
- **Cross-Browser**: Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome/Safari
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with mobile touch optimization
