## Constitutional Requirements (Critical)

### **Plan ID Integrity**
The platform must **never use hardcoded plan IDs**. All plan identification must be dynamic through MongoDB ObjectId resolution to prevent wrong plan orders.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Dynamic plan ID resolution via `/api/plans/search`
- MongoDB ObjectId format validation (`/^[0-9a-f]{24}$/`)
- Automated validation preventing hardcoded patterns (`/^68b[0-9a-f]{21}$/`)
- Database-first architecture with JSON fallbacks

### **ESID Accuracy**
Electric Service Identifiers must be **generated from addresses**, never hardcoded, to ensure accurate service connections.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Address-based ESID generation via ERCOT APIs
- ZIP code pattern analysis for TDSP territory mapping
- Format validation (`/^10\d{15}$/`) with geographic accuracy
- Integration with USPS address validation services

### **Real Data Architecture**
The system must use **100% real data** from database and API sources, with zero mock data usage.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM as primary data source
- Generated JSON files (881 cities) as fallback data source
- ComparePower API integration for real-time plan data
- Service layer abstraction with error handling and fallbacks
