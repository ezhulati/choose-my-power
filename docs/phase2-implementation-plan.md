### Day 3-4: Scalable Architecture Implementation  
**Owner:** backend-engineer

#### Dynamic Route Architecture
```typescript
// src/pages/texas/[city]/[...filters]/index.astro
// Dynamic route handling thousands of combinations
```

#### Static Generation Strategy
- Implement build-time generation for top 500 high-value pages:
  - Major metro city pages (Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Fort Worth)
  - Single filter pages for top 25 cities (12-month, fixed-rate, green-energy)
  - High-traffic combinations (12-month + fixed-rate for major cities)

#### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Configure ISR for dynamic updates without full rebuilds
- Set up cache invalidation strategies
- Implement background regeneration for stale pages

**Deliverables:**

- ISR system functional with cache management

### Day 5-6: Mass SEO Infrastructure
**Owner:** seo-strategist

#### Template System Architecture
- Create template variations to prevent duplicate content:
  - 5 different intro paragraph templates per filter type
  - Variable content sections based on city characteristics
  - Dynamic FAQ sections tailored to filter combinations
  - Localized content based on TDSP service areas

#### Canonical URL Strategy
```typescript
// Canonical hierarchy for thousands of pages:
// /texas/dallas-tx/ (self-canonical)
// /texas/dallas-tx/12-month/ (self-canonical)
// /texas/dallas-tx/12-month/fixed-rate/ (self-canonical)
// /texas/dallas-tx/12-month/fixed-rate/green-energy/ (canonical to parent)
```

#### Schema Markup at Scale
- Automated BreadcrumbList generation for all page depths
- ItemList schema for plan listings
- LocalBusiness schema for major metro areas
- Product schema for individual plans

**Deliverables:**
- SEO template system handling 10,000+ combinations
- Canonical strategy implemented across all page types
- Schema markup generating automatically for all pages

  - Static assets: 1 year cache

#### Database Optimization
- Index optimization for faceted queries at scale
- Connection pooling for high concurrent requests
- Query optimization for filter combinations
- Real-time performance monitoring setup

#### API Caching Strategy
- Redis caching for ComparePower API responses

- Real-time monitoring with automatic rollback triggers
- CDN and caching optimization before mass deployment

#### 2. Duplicate Content Penalties
**Risk:** Google penalizing similar pages across thousands of cities
**Mitigation:**
- 5 template variations per content type
- City-specific content injection
- Strict canonical hierarchy implementation
- Content quality scoring and monitoring

#### 3. TDSP Data Accuracy Issues
**Risk:** Incorrect TDSP mappings affecting user experience
**Mitigation:**
- Automated validation against ComparePower API
- Manual spot-checking for top 50 cities
- User reporting system for data issues
- Quarterly TDSP mapping audits
