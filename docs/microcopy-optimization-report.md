## üéØ Optimization Approach

### Core Principles Applied
1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** - Every message answers: "What happens next?"
2. **Specificity Over Generic** - "Show My Plans" vs "Submit"
3. **Empathy Over Authority** - "That didn't work. Try again?" vs "Error: Invalid input"
4. **Guidance Over Instructions** - "What street are you on?" vs "Enter street address"
5. **Encouragement Over Pressure** - "Almost ready..." vs "Please wait"
