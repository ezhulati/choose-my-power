(i) has been a customer of any electric utility for the same kind of service within the
last two years;
(ii) is not delinquent in payment of any such electric utility service account;
(iii) during the last 12 consecutive months of service was not late in paying a bill more
than once;
(iv) did not have service disconnected for nonpayment; and
(v) is encouraged to obtain a letter of credit history from the applicant’s previous
electric utility, and electric utilities are encouraged to provide such information
with the final bill.
(B) The residential applicant demonstrates a satisfactory credit rating by appropriate means,
including, but not limited to, the production of:
(i) generally acceptable credit cards;
(ii) letters of credit reference;
(iii) the names of credit references which may be quickly and inexpensively contacted
by the electric utility; or
(iv) ownership of substantial equity that is easily liquidated.
(C) The residential applicant is 65 years of age or older and does not have an outstanding
account balance incurred within the last two years with the electric utility or another electric
utility for the same type of utility service.
(3) If satisfactory credit cannot be demonstrated by the residential applicant using these criteria, the
applicant may be required to pay a deposit pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.
(b) Credit requirements for non-residential applicants. For non-residential service, if an applicant’s credit
has not been demonstrated satisfactorily to the electric utility, the applicant may be required to pay a deposit.
(c) Initial deposits.
(1) A residential applicant or customer who is required to pay an initial deposit may provide the electric
utility with a written letter of guarantee pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, instead of paying
a cash deposit.
(2) An initial deposit may not be required from an existing customer unless the customer was late paying
a bill more than once during the last 12 months of service or had service disconnected for
nonpayment. The customer may be required to pay this initial deposit within ten days after issuance
of a written termination notice that requests such deposit. Instead of an initial deposit, the customer
may pay the total amount due on the current bill by the due date of the bill, provided the customer
has not exercised this option in the previous 12 months.
(d) Additional deposits.
(1) An additional deposit may be required if:
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 3/10/16
(A) the average of the customer’s actual billings for the last 12 months are at least twice the
amount of the original estimated annual billings; and
(B) a disconnection notice has been issued for the account within the previous 12 months.
(2) An electric utility may require that an additional deposit be paid within ten days after the electric
utility has issued a written disconnection notice and requested the additional deposit.
(3) Instead of an additional deposit, the customer may pay the total amount due on the current bill by
the due date of the bill, provided the customer has not exercised this option in the previous 12
months.
(4) The electric utility may disconnect service if the additional deposit is not paid within ten days of the
request, provided a written disconnection notice has been issued to the customer. A disconnection
notice may be issued concurrently with either the written request for the additional deposit or current
usage payment.
(e) Deposits for temporary or seasonal service and for weekend residences. The electric utility may require
a deposit sufficient to reasonably protect it against the assumed risk for temporary or seasonal service or
weekend residences, as long as the policy is applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. These
deposits shall be returned according to guidelines set out in subsection (k) of this section.
(f) Amount of deposit. The total of all deposits shall not exceed an amount equivalent to one-sixth of the
estimated annual billing.
(g) Interest on deposits. Each electric utility requiring deposits shall pay interest on these deposits at an annual
rate at least equal to that set by the commission on or before December 1 of the preceding calendar year,
pursuant to Texas Utilities Code §183.003 (relating to Rate of Interest). If a deposit is refunded within 30
days of the date of deposit, no interest payment is required. If the electric utility keeps the deposit more than
30 days, payment of interest shall be made retroactive to the date of deposit.
(1) Payment of the interest to the customer shall be made annually, if requested by the customer, or at
the time the deposit is returned or credited to the customer’s account.
(2) The deposit shall cease to draw interest on the date it is returned or credited to the customer’s

Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 3/10/16
(j) Guarantees of residential customer accounts.
(1) A guarantee agreement between an electric utility and a guarantor must be in writing and shall be
for no more than the amount of deposit the electric utility would require on the applicant’s account
pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. The amount of the guarantee shall be clearly indicated in
the signed agreement.
(2) The guarantee shall be voided and returned to the guarantor according to the provisions of subsection
(k) of this section.
(3) Upon default by a residential customer, the guarantor of that customer’s account shall be responsible
for the unpaid balance of the account only up to the amount agreed to in the written agreement.
(4) The electric utility shall provide written notification to the guarantor of the customer’s default, the
amount owed by the guarantor, and the due date for the amount owed.
(A) The electric utility shall allow the guarantor 16 days from the date of notification to pay
the amount owed on the defaulted account. If the sixteenth day falls on a holiday or
weekend, the due date shall be the next workday.
(B) The electric utility may transfer the amount owed on the defaulted account to the
guarantor’s own service bill provided the guaranteed amount owed is identified separately
on the bill as required by §25.25(c)(10) of this title (relating to the Issuance and Format of
Bills).
(5) The electric utility may disconnect service to the guarantor for nonpayment of the guaranteed
amount only if the disconnection was included in the terms of the written agreement, and only after
proper notice as described by paragraph (4) of this subsection, and §25.29(b)(5) of this title (relating
to Disconnection of Service).
(k) Refunding deposits and voiding letters of guarantee.
(1) If service is not connected, or is disconnected, the electric utility shall promptly void and return to
the guarantor all letters of guarantee on the account or provide written documentation that the
contract has been voided, or refund the customer’s deposit plus accrued interest on the balance, if
any, in excess of the unpaid bills for service furnished. A transfer of service from one premise to
another within the service area of the electric utility is not a disconnection, and no additional deposit
may be required.
(2) When the customer has paid bills for service for 12 consecutive residential billings or for
24 consecutive non-residential billings without having service disconnected for nonpayment of a
bill and without having more than two occasions in which a bill was delinquent, and when the
customer is not delinquent in the payment of the current bills, the electric utility shall promptly
refund the deposit plus accrued interest to the customer, or void and return the guarantee or provide
written documentation that the contract has been voided. If the customer does not meet these refund
criteria, the deposit and interest or the letter of guarantee may be retained.
(l) Re-establishment of credit. Every applicant who previously has been a customer of the electric utility and
whose service has been disconnected for nonpayment of bills or theft of service (meter tampering or
bypassing of meter) shall be required, before service is reconnected, to pay all amounts due the utility or
execute a deferred payment agreement, if offered, and reestablish credit. The electric utility must prove the
amount of utility service received but not paid for and the reasonableness of any charges for the unpaid
service, and any other charges required to be paid as a condition of service restoration.
(m) Upon sale or transfer of utility or company. Upon the sale or transfer of any electric utility or any of its
operating units, the seller shall provide the buyer all required deposit records.

(10) To the extent that a utility uses the concepts identified in this paragraph in a customer’s bill, it shall
use the term set out in this paragraph, and the definitions in this paragraph shall be easily located on
the utility’s website. A utility may not use a different term for a charge that is defined in this
paragraph.
(A) Current Meter Read -- The meter reading at the end of the period for which the customer
is being billed;
(B) kW -- Kilowatt, the standard unit for measuring electricity demand, equal to 1,000 watts;
(C) kWh -- Kilowatt-hour, the standard unit for measuring electricity energy consumption,
equal to 1.000 watt-hours; and
(D) Previous Meter Read -- The reading on the beginning the period for which the customer is
being billed.
(d) Estimated bills.
(1) An electric utility may submit estimated bills for good cause provided that an actual meter reading
is taken no less than every third month. In months where the meter reader is unable to gain access
to the premises to read the meter on regular meter reading trips, or in months when meters are not
read, the electric utility must provide the customer with a postcard and request the customer to read
the meter and return the card to the electric utility. If the postcard is not received by the electric
utility in time for billing, the electric utility may estimate the meter reading and issue a bill.
(2) If an electric utility has a program in which customers read their own meters and report their usage
monthly and no meter reading is submitted by a customer the electric utility may estimate the
customer’s usage and issue a bill. However, the electric utility must read the meter if the customer
does not submit readings for three consecutive months so that a corrected bill may be issued.
(e) Record retention. Each electric utility shall maintain monthly billing records for each account for at least
two years after the date the bill is mailed. The billing records shall contain sufficient data to reconstruct a
customer’s billing for a given month. Copies of a customer’s billing records may be obtained by that
customer on request.
(f) Transfer of delinquent balances. If the customer has an outstanding balance due from another account in
the same customer class, then the utility may transfer that balance to the customer’s current account. The
delinquent balance and specific account shall be identified as such on the bill.

Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 3/02/99
§25.27. Retail Electric Service Switchovers.
(a) Right to switchover.
(1) General principles. A consumer has the right to switch retail electric service to any electric or
municipally owned utility that has the right to provide service in the area in which the consumer’s
consuming facility is located, subject to the terms of any contract for electric service entered into
pursuant to the disconnecting utility’s tariff. Because a consuming facility for which a switchover is
sought can obtain electric service from the disconnecting utility prior to the switchover, an electric or
municipally owned utility shall give a switchover a lower priority than the elimination of outages and
requests for service to consuming facilities that do not have service. Nevertheless, a switchover shall
be performed as soon as reasonably possible, and the disconnecting and connecting utilities shall strive
to take the actions required below more quickly than the deadlines listed below. In addition, the
disconnecting and connecting utilities shall minimize any outages related to making a switchover.
(2) Options and availability. This section provides two switchover options: partial switchover and full
switchover. All subsections of this section apply to electric utilities, while only subsections (a), (c),
(e), and (g) of this section apply to municipally owned utilities. The partial switchover option is not
available in a particular area prior to September 1, 1999 and prior to such time as both the
disconnecting and connecting utilities have approved tariffs for transmission service at the
transmission and primary and secondary distribution voltage levels. Until the utilities have such
approved tariffs, subsections (d) and (e) of this section do not apply. In addition, the partial switchover
option is not available to the extent that it would reduce the state’s jurisdiction over a utility. The
provisions for full switchovers in this section become effective for a particular area once the electric
utilities that have a right to provide service in the area have tariffs in effect that are consistent with this
section.
(3) Limitations and refunds. A consuming facility may not be switched more than once every
12 months. A consumer or connecting utility who pays a switchover fee does not waive the right to
seek a refund on the basis that the switchover fee was excessive. In addition, a connecting utility or
consumer who buys facilities pursuant to this section waives the right to seek a refund only if it
expressly agrees to waive that right.
(b) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings.
(1) Idle facilities - The disconnecting utility’s facilities that are used to serve only the consuming facility
being switched, as well as the easements for these facilities. For consuming facilities served above
480 volts, idle facilities also include costs, or a portion of costs, pertaining to the upgrade of
transmission and distribution facilities that were necessary to serve the consuming facility, if the
current or prior owner of the consuming facility agreed to pay the costs upon switching. In all other
respects, idle facilities do not include facilities that were installed or are being used to serve more than
one consuming facility, including: facilities that were designed with a capacity greater than necessary
to serve the consuming facility being switched in order that additional consuming facilities could be
served using the facilities in the future; and upgrades that were made to common facilities in order to
serve the consuming facility being switched.
(2) Common facilities - The disconnecting utility’s facilities that are used, installed, or designed to serve
more than one consuming facility, except as specified in the definition of idle facilities.
(c) Documentation. The requests, notices, offers, agreements, and switchover requests provided for in this
section must be in writing, unless otherwise indicated.
(d) Notice of switchover options. Upon receiving an oral switchover request, the disconnecting utility shall at
that time orally describe the two switchover options, including stating that there is no charge for a partial
switchover, stating that there will be a switchover fee for a full switchover, stating that switchover requests
must be in writing, stating that written general information on switchover fees will be provided within two
working days, and providing a fax number and mailing address to send the switchover request. Within two 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 3/02/99
working days of a switchover request that does not specify whether a partial or full switchover is being
requested, the disconnecting utility shall provide the consumer a document describing the two switchover
options, including a statement that there is no charge for a partial switchover, specifying for a full switchover
the base charge and base charge adder and stating that the facilities recovery charge will vary depending on
the circumstances, and providing the deadlines prescribed in subsection (f)(2)(C) of this subsection for the
disconnecting utility to notify the connecting utility after payment of the switchover fee that the full
switchover can proceed.
(e) Partial switchover.
(1) Description. Under the partial switchover option, the connecting utility provides power to the
consuming facility using the disconnecting utility’s transmission and/or distribution facilities. The
disconnecting utility shall provide the connecting utility transmission service to the same point of
delivery that the disconnecting utility provided electricity to the consuming facility prior to the
switchover. Except where necessary or where the connecting utility requests it, all of the
disconnecting utility’s facilities needed to serve the consuming facility prior to the switchover shall
remain in place. The disconnecting utility may not charge a switchover fee for a partial switchover,
except that it may charge the connecting utility a cost-based fee where the connecting utility requests
that the disconnecting utility remove facilities that were needed by the disconnecting utility to serve
the consuming facility prior to the switchover. In addition, the disconnecting utility may charge a
switching customer any account closing fee that applies to all departing customers, not just switching
customers.
(2) Procedure for partial switchover. The disconnecting utility shall contact the connecting utility
within three working days of receiving a request for a partial switchover in order to coordinate the
switchover. The switchover shall occur within eight working days of the disconnecting utility’s receipt
of the request, unless the consumer agrees to a longer schedule or unless good cause exists for not
completing the switchover within eight working days. If the switchover will not be completed within
eight working days, then the disconnecting utility must notify the consumer, with copies to the
commission’s Office of Customer Protection and to the connecting utility, providing the reasons why
the switchover has been delayed and when the switchover will be completed. This notice must be
provided as soon as possible, by fax to the commission’s Office of Customer Protection, connecting
utility, and, if possible, the consumer.
(f) Full switchover. A full switchover involves the disconnecting utility disconnecting its facilities and the
connecting utility installing and/or purchasing transmission and/or distribution facilities to serve the
consuming facility. If the consumer is a tenant, the consumer must obtain the clear and specific agreement
of the owner or owner’s agent to switch over the consuming facility and must provide it to the disconnecting
utility as an attachment to a notarized affidavit stating that the consumer has obtained the owner’s or owner’s
agent’s agreement. This subsection does not apply within municipalities exercising original jurisdiction that
enacted switchover rules by August 28, 1998 that provide for more expeditious full switchovers than provided
by this subsection.
(1) Switchover fee. The switchover fee applies regardless of whether the consumer requesting the
switchover has ever received service from the disconnecting utility at the consuming facility. The fee
consists of a base charge and, where applicable, a base charge adder and facilities recovery charge.
The disconnecting utility may not include in the switchover fee a charge for general administrative
expenses related to closing the consumer’s account. However, the disconnecting utility shall charge
a switching customer any account closing fee that applies to all departing customers, not just switching
customers. Where the disconnecting utility is allowed to charge for the original cost of facilities, it
must deduct contributions in aid of construction that apply to those facilities. Accumulated
depreciation shall be calculated using the depreciation rates that are currently used to book
depreciation. Upon the payment of the switchover fee or purchase, or refusal of an offer to purchase,
under the circumstances described in subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph, any construction charges 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 3/02/99
owed by the consumer, pursuant to a contract entered into after the effective date of this subsection,
for idle facilities used to provide service to the consuming facility being switched are extinguished.
(A) Base charge and base charge adder. A base charge applies to the switchover of a consuming
facility served at 480 volts or less. The base charge is equal to the cost of removing any meter
and drop line used to serve the consuming facility, and shall be specified in the disconnecting
utility’s tariff. The switchover fee shall not include the original cost less depreciation and gross
salvage of the meter and drop line for switchovers for which the base charge applies. A base
charge adder that is less than the base charge must also be specified in the tariff to cover the
situation where a consumer switches more than one consuming facility on the same premises at
the same time. The base charge adder is equal to the cost of removing any meter and drop line
used to serve each additional consuming facility.
(B) Facilities recovery charge. The purpose of the facilities recovery charge is to recover costs
related to idle facilities, other than meter and drop line costs covered by a base charge or base
charge adder.
(i) Availability of facilities recovery charge. The disconnecting utility may not impose a
facilities recovery charge for idle facilities if the connecting utility or consumer
purchases the idle facilities at a price equal to net book value and signs an agreement
indemnifying the disconnecting utility from liability for the facilities after the purchase
of the facilities. Before a consumer can purchase the facilities, it must prove that it has
the financial resources to protect the disconnecting utility from liability risks resulting
from the sale. Where more than one consumer requests a switchover, the disconnecting
utility may not impose a facilities recovery charge for idle facilities if the connecting
utility purchases the idle facilities and the common facilities used to serve the consuming
facilities being switched, but not used to serve any consuming facilities not being
switched, at a price equal to replacement cost less depreciation and signs an indemnity
agreement. Replacement cost is equal to: the average original cost of like facilities
installed in the most recent full calendar year for which information is available, that
would be necessary to serve the consuming facilities being switched if facilities were
first installed to serve the consuming facilities at the time of the switchover requests;
plus the cost of easements for the facilities if the easements were obtained at the time of
the switchover requests. The disconnecting utility also may not impose a facilities
recovery charge if it refuses an offer to purchase under the conditions described in this
subparagraph.
(ii) Components of facilities recovery charge. The facilities recovery charge consists of the
net book value (original cost less depreciation) less net salvage (gross salvage less cost
of removal) of the idle facilities. In determining the net book value of the facilities, the
original cost of the specific facilities should be used. If the original cost of the specific
facilities is not available, the installation date of the facilities shall be determined or
estimated and the average original cost of like facilities installed by the disconnecting
utility in that year shall be used. If average original cost information is not available for
the year in which the idle facilities were installed, then the average original cost of like
facilities installed in the most recent full calendar year for which information is available
shall be used and shall be deflated to the installation date of the idle facilities. Where
average original cost information is used, the average original cost information shall be
determined using the information for the operating division in which the consuming
facility to be switched is located, if the disconnecting utility maintains original cost
information by division.
(C) Labor charges. Labor charges for removing facilities are limited to a reasonable estimate of the
direct labor cost (salary, insurance, pension, payroll taxes, etc.) for the time of persons needed
to remove the facilities. No allocation of general overhead labor is allowed, but any necessary
supervisory or engineering labor specific to the removal of the facilities may be included.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 3/02/99
(D) Quantification of charges. The calculation of the base charge, base charge adder, and facilities
recovery charge may involve the making of estimates. To the extent that there is a range of
reasonable estimates for a particular charge, the estimate at the low end of the range should be
used, so that the amount of the switchover fee will be minimized, but still be reasonable and in
conformance with this section. Unless the consumer agrees otherwise, there will be no refund
or surcharge if the actual cost of performing the switchover is less than or greater than the
switchover fee. Instead of a utility-specific base charge and base charge adder, the commission
may, through the issuance of an order, establish a single base charge and a single base charge
adder to be used by all electric utilities. Likewise, the commission may, through the issuance of
an order, establish fixed dollar charges for components of the facilities recovery charge.
(E) Payment of switchover fee and other charges. Before the connecting utility provides service, the
disconnecting utility has the right to receive payment of the switchover fee and any other
outstanding charges. The connecting utility shall not reimburse the consumer for the switchover
fee, and may pay the switchover fee only if the consumer agrees prior to the connecting utility’s
payment of the fee that the consumer will reimburse the connecting utility for the fee. The
agreement must contain a plan for the payment of the fee within a reasonable period of time.
(2) Procedure for full switchover.
(A) Notice of switchover fee and procedure. Upon receiving a request for a full switchover, the
disconnecting utility must provide the consumer a document that quantifies the switchover fee
within 15 working days. This document must be in 12 point, non-bold type and must itemize
the base charge, base charge adder, and the facilities recovery charge of the switchover fee. In
addition, the document must itemize the components of the facilities recovery charge, including
a description of the idle facilities, the installation dates of the idle facilities, the original cost of
the idle facilities, the accumulated depreciation associated with the idle facilities, the
depreciation rates used to calculate the accumulated depreciation, transportation charges for
removing the idle facilities, labor rates, labor hours for removing the idle facilities, and the gross
salvage value of the idle facilities. The document must also state immediately below these
itemizations, in bold, and in not less than 12 point type: “(Disconnecting utility) may not impose
a facilities recovery charge under the circumstances described in Public Utility Commission of
Texas Substantive Rule §25.27(f)(1)(B)(i). On request, you will be provided a copy of Rule
§25.27.”
(B) Sale of both common and idle facilities. If a group of consumers request switchovers, the
switchovers may necessitate that the connecting utility acquire common and idle facilities in that
case. Within 15 working days of receipt of a request from the connecting utility, the
disconnecting utility must provide by fax and mail a detailed, reasonable estimate of replacement
cost less depreciation for the idle facilities and the common facilities used to serve the consuming
facilities to be switched, but not used to serve any consuming facilities not being switched.
(C) Offer to purchase facilities. Within five working days of receipt of an offer to purchase idle
and/or common facilities under the conditions described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) of this subsection,
the disconnecting utility must notify the connecting utility by fax, with copies by mail or fax to
the consumers, whether it accepts or rejects the offer. If the disconnecting utility rejects the
offer, it must also provide revised switchover fees that delete the facilities recovery charges, at
the same time that it provides notice of rejection of the offer.
(D) Payment of switchover fee and outstanding balances. Until the switchover fee and all
outstanding balances are paid to the disconnecting utility, neither the disconnecting utility nor
the connecting utility is under any obligation to take steps to make the switchover, and the
connecting utility must not provide service to the consuming facility being switched until it
receives notice from the disconnecting utility that the switchover can proceed. The
disconnecting utility must within the following deadlines from the receipt of payment, notify the
connecting utility by fax that the switchover can proceed: two working days for payment by
cash, money order, cashier’s check, or, if accepted by the disconnecting utility for bill payment,
credit card, and five working days for payment by personal check or other forms of payment.

(E) Deadline for full switchover. Once the disconnecting utility notifies the connecting utility that
the switchover can proceed and once the connecting utility notifies the disconnecting utility by
fax that the consumer has satisfied the conditions for service from the connecting utility, the
switchover must be completed within ten working days unless the consumer agrees to a longer
schedule, good cause exists for the disconnecting utility not being able to complete the
switchover within ten working days, or the connecting utility needs more time to install facilities,
so long as the connecting utility complies with the rules concerning responses to requests for
service that apply regardless of whether the request relates to a switchover. If the disconnecting
utility does not meet the deadline, then the disconnecting utility must notify the consumer, with
copies to the commission’s Office of Customer Protection and the connecting utility, providing
the reasons why the switchover has been delayed and when the switchover will be completed.
This notice must be provided as soon as possible, by fax to the commission’s Office of Customer
Protection, the connecting utility and, if possible, the consumer.
(F) Consumer’s failure to pay. The consumer may continue to incur charges for retail electric
service from the disconnecting utility after the consumer pays the switchover fee and outstanding
balances, and may have an unfulfilled contractual obligation that requires future payment of
charges to the disconnecting utility. The disconnecting utility has the right to payment of these
charges consistent with §23.45 of this title (relating to Billing). If the consumer has not paid the
charges within the appropriate time, the disconnecting utility may notify the connecting utility
of the consumer’s failure to pay and request that the consumer be disconnected, and must at the
same time provide a copy of the notice to the consumer, by fax if possible. Upon receipt of such
notification and request and upon receipt from the disconnecting utility of an agreement
indemnifying the connecting utility from liability for improper cause for disconnection of
service, the connecting utility must disconnect the consumer’s service in compliance with the
procedures in §23.46 of this title (relating to Discontinuance of Service). Immediately upon
verification of the consumer’s correction of its failure, the disconnecting utility must notify the
connecting utility by fax that the consumer’s failure has been corrected, and the connecting
utility must immediately reconnect service. The connecting utility shall charge a switching
customer any disconnection or reconnection fee that applies to all disconnected customers, not
just those who have been disconnected pursuant to this subparagraph.
(g) Complaint concerning a switchover. A consumer complaint to the commission concerning a switchover
shall be handled according to §23.41(c) of this title (relating to Customer Relations), with the following
modification. The commission will forward a complaint that it receives to both the disconnecting utility and
the connecting utility, and both utilities must provide an initial response within the deadline specified in
§23.41(c).
(h) Compliance tariff provisions. An electric utility that has the right to serve in an area for which another
utility also has the right to provide retail electric service shall include in its tariff a section entitled “Retail
Electric Service Switchovers”. Immediately below this title, the tariff shall state: “A request to switch service
to a consuming facility to another utility that has the right to serve the facility shall be handled pursuant to
Public Utility Commission of Texas Substantive Rule §25.27, a copy of which will be provided upon
request.” Immediately below this statement, the tariff must specify the electric utility’s base charge and base
charge adder. The electric utility’s tariff shall not include any other information addressing retail electric
service switchovers.

§25.28. Bill Payment and Adjustments.
(a) Bill due date. The bill provided to the customer shall include the payment due date which shall not be less
than 16 days after issuance. The issuance date is the postmark date on the envelope or the issuance date on
the bill if there is no postmark on the envelope. A payment for electric utility service is delinquent if not
received at the electric utility or at the electric utility’s authorized payment agency by the close of business
on the due date. If the sixteenth day falls on a holiday or weekend, then the due date shall be the next work
day after the sixteenth day.
(b) Penalty on delinquent bills for retail service. A one-time penalty not to exceed 5.0% may be charged on
a delinquent commercial or industrial bill. The 5.0% penalty on delinquent bills may not be applied to any
balance to which the penalty has already been applied. An electric utility providing any service to the state
of Texas shall not assess a fee, penalty, interest, or other charge to the state for delinquent payment of a bill.
(c) Overbilling. If charges are found to be higher than authorized in the utility’s tariffs, then the customer’s bill
shall be corrected.
(1) The correction shall be made for the entire period of the overbilling.
(2) If the utility corrects the overbilling within three billing cycles of the error, it need not pay interest
on the amount of the correction.
(3) If the utility does not correct the overcharge within three billing cycles of the error, it shall pay
interest on the amount of the overcharge at the rate set by the commission each year.
(A) The interest rate shall be based on an average of prime commercial paper rates for the
previous 12 months.
(B) Interest on overcharges that are not adjusted by the electric utility within three billing
cycles of the bill in error shall accrue from the date of payment or from the date of the bill
in error.
(C) All interest shall be compounded monthly based on the annual rate.
(D) Interest shall not apply to leveling plans or estimated billings.
(d) Underbilling. If charges are found to be lower than authorized by the utility’s tariffs, or if the electric utility
failed to bill the customer for service, then the customer’s bill may be corrected.
(1) The electric utility may backbill the customer for the amount that was underbilled. The backbilling
shall not collect charges that extend more than six months from the date the error was discovered
unless the underbilling is a result of theft of service by the customer.
(2) The electric utility may disconnect service if the customer fails to pay underbilled charges.
(3) If the underbilling is $50 or more, the electric utility shall offer the customer a deferred payment
plan option for the same length of time as that of the underbilling. A deferred payment plan need
not be offered to a customer whose underpayment is due to theft of service.
(4) The utility shall not charge interest on underbilled amounts unless such amounts are found to be the
result of theft of service (meter tampering, bypass, or diversion) by the customer, as defined in
§25.126 of this title (relating to Adjustments Due to Non-Compliant Meters and Meter Tampering
in Areas Where Customer Choice Has Been Introduced). Interest on underbilled amounts shall be
compounded monthly at the annual rate and shall accrue from the day the customer is found to have
first stolen (tampered, bypassed or diverted) the service.
(e) Disputed bills.
(1) If there is a dispute between a customer and an electric utility about a bill for service, the electric
utility shall investigate and report the results to the customer. If the dispute is not resolved, the
electric utility shall inform the customer of the complaint procedures of the commission pursuant to
§25.30 of this title (relating to Complaints).
(2) A customer’s service shall not be disconnected for nonpayment of the disputed portion of the bill
until the dispute is completely resolved by the electric utility. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 1/09/14
(3) If the customer files a complaint with the commission, a customer’s service shall not be
disconnected for nonpayment of the disputed portion of the bill before the commission completes
its informal complaint resolution process and informs the customer of its determination.
(4) The customer is obligated to pay any billings not disputed.
(f) Notice of alternate payment programs or payment assistance. When a customer contacts an electric
utility and indicates inability to pay a bill or a need for assistance with the bill payment, the electric utility
shall inform the customer of all alternative payment and payment assistance programs available from the
electric utility, such as deferred payment plans, disconnection moratoriums for the ill, payment assistance
program for veterans severely burned in combat, or energy assistance programs, as applicable, and of the
eligibility requirements and procedure for applying for each.
(g) Level and average payment plans. Electric utilities with seasonal usage patterns or seasonal demands are
encouraged to offer a level or average payment plan.
(1) The payment plan may use one of the following methods:
(A) A level payment plan allowing residential customers to pay one-twelfth of that customer’s
estimated annual consumption at the appropriate customer class rates each month, with
provisions for annual adjustments as may be determined based on actual electric use.
(B) An average payment plan allowing residential customers to pay one-twelfth of the sum of
that customer’s current month’s consumption plus the previous 11 months consumption
(or an estimate, for a new customer) at the appropriate customer class rates each month,
plus a portion of any unbilled balance.
(2) If a customer for electric utility service does not fulfill the terms and obligations of a level payment
agreement or an average payment plan, the electric utility shall have the right to disconnect service
to that customer pursuant to §25.29 of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service).
(3) The electric utility may require a customer deposit from all customers entering into level payment
plans or average payment plans pursuant to the requirements §25.24 of this title (relating to Credit
Requirements and Deposits). The electric utility shall pay interest on the deposit and may retain the
deposit for the duration of the level or average payment plan.
(h) Payment arrangements. A payment arrangement is any agreement between the electric utility and a
customer that allows a customer to pay the outstanding bill after its due date but before the due date of the
next bill. If the utility issued a disconnection notice before the payment arrangement was made, that
disconnection should be suspended until after the due date for the payment arrangement. If a customer does
not fulfill the terms of the payment arrangements, the electric utility may disconnect service after the later of
the due date for the payment arrangement or the disconnection date indicated in the disconnection notice,
pursuant to §25.29 of this title without issuing an additional disconnection notice.
(i) Deferred payment plans. A deferred payment plan is any written arrangement between the electric utility
and a customer that allows a customer to pay an outstanding bill in installments that extend beyond the due
date of the next bill. A deferred payment plan may be established in person or by telephone, and all deferred
payment plans shall be put in writing.
(1) The electric utility shall offer a deferred payment plan to any residential customer, including a
guarantor of any residential customer, who has expressed an inability to pay all of the bill, if that
customer has not been issued more than two disconnection notices during the preceding 12 months.
(2) Every deferred payment plan shall provide that the delinquent amount may be paid in equal
installments lasting at least three billing cycles.
(3) When a customer has received service from its current electric utility for less than three months, the
electric utility is not required to offer a deferred payment plan if the customer lacks:
(A) sufficient credit; or
(B) a satisfactory history of payment for service from a previous utility.
(4) Every deferred payment plan offered by an electric utility: 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 1/09/14
(A) shall state, immediately preceding the space provided for the customer’s signature and in
boldface type no smaller than 14 point size, the following: “If you are not satisfied with
this contract, or if agreement was made by telephone and you feel this contract does
not reflect your understanding of that agreement, contact the electric utility
immediately and do not sign this contract. If you do not contact the electric utility,
or if you sign this agreement, you may give up your right to dispute the amount due
under the agreement except for the electric utility’s failure or refusal to comply with
the terms of this agreement.” In addition, where the customer and the electric utility
representative or agent meet in person, the electric utility representative shall read the
preceding statement to the customer. The electric utility shall provide information to the
customer in English and Spanish as necessary to make the preceding boldface language
understandable to the customer;
(B) may include a 5.0% penalty for late payment but shall not include a finance charge;
(C) shall state the length of time covered by the plan;
(D) shall state the total amount to be paid under the plan;
(E) shall state the specific amount of each installment;
(F) shall allow the electric utility to disconnect service if the customer does not fulfill the terms
of the deferred payment plan, and shall state the terms for disconnection;
(G) shall not refuse a customer participation in such a program on the basis of race, color, sex,
nationality, religion, or marital status;
(H) shall be signed by the customer and a copy of the signed plan must be provided to the
customer. If the agreement is made over the telephone, then the electric utility shall send
a copy of the plan to the customer for signature; and
(I) shall allow either the customer or the electric utility to initiate a renegotiation of the
deferred payment plan if the customer’s economic or financial circumstances change
substantially during the time of the deferred payment plan.
(5) An electric utility may disconnect a customer who does not meet the terms of a deferred payment
plan. However, the electric utility may not disconnect service until a disconnection notice has been
issued to the customer indicating that the customer has not met the terms of the plan. The notice and
disconnection shall conform with the disconnection rules in §25.29 of this title. The electric utility
may renegotiate the deferred payment plan agreement prior to disconnection. If the customer did
not sign the deferred payment plan, and is not otherwise fulfilling the terms of the plan, and the
customer was previously provided a disconnection notice for the outstanding amount, no additional
disconnection notice shall be required.
(j) Recovery of costs associated with burned veteran payment assistance program.
(1) An electric utility shall be allowed to recover a cost or expense of the bill payment assistance
program established for military veterans when a medical doctor has certified that the veteran has
significantly decreased ability to regulate the body temperature because of severe burns received in
combat.
(2) The electric utility is entitled to:
(A) Fully recover all costs and expenses related to the bill payment assistance program;
(B) Defer each cost or expense related to the bill payment assistance program not explicitly
included in base rates; and
(C) Apply carrying charges at the utility’s weighted average cost of capital to the extent related
to the bill payment assistance program. Carrying charges shall be calculated by
multiplying the balance of deferred costs and expenses of the bill payment assistance
program by the utility’s weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as established for the
utility in a final commission order in a base rate case, provided that the order was filed
within three years prior to the initiation of the bill payment assistance program. Otherwise,
a proxy WACC shall be used, with a cost of equity of 10%; and the capital structure and
cost of debt as reported in the utility’s most recent Earnings Monitoring Report filed

§25.29. Disconnection of Service.
(a) Disconnection policy. If an electric utility chooses to disconnect a customer, it must follow the procedures
below, or modify them in ways that are more generous to the customer in terms of the cause for disconnection,
the timing of the disconnection notice, and the period between notice and disconnection. Each electric utility
is encouraged to develop specific policies for disconnection that treat its customers with dignity and respect
its customers’ or members’ circumstances and payment history, and to implement those policies in ways that
are consistent and non-discriminatory. Disconnection is an option allowed by the commission, not a
requirement placed upon the utility by the commission.
(b) Disconnection with notice. Electric utility service may be disconnected after proper notice for any of these
reasons:
(1) failure to pay a bill for electric utility service or make deferred payment arrangements by the date
of disconnection;
(2) failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement;
(3) violation of the electric utility’s rules on using service in a manner which interferes with the service
of others or the operation of nonstandard equipment, if a reasonable attempt has been made to notify
the customer and the customer is provided with a reasonable opportunity to remedy the situation;
(4) failure to pay a deposit as required by §25.24 of this title (relating to Credit Requirements and
Deposits); or
(5) failure of the guarantor to pay the amount guaranteed, when the electric utility has a written
agreement, signed by the guarantor, that allows for disconnection of the guarantor’s service.
(c) Disconnection without prior notice. Electric utility service may be disconnected without prior notice for
any of the following reasons:
(1) where a known dangerous condition exists for as long as the condition exists. Where reasonable,
given the nature of the hazardous condition, the electric utility shall post a notice of disconnection
and the reason for the disconnection at the place of common entry or upon the front door of each
affected residential unit as soon as possible after service has been disconnected;
(2) where service is connected without authority by a person who has not made application for service;
(3) where service was reconnected without authority after termination for nonpayment; or
(4) where there has been tampering with the electric utility company’s equipment or evidence of theft
of service.
(d) Disconnection prohibited. Electric utility service may not be disconnected for any of the following reasons:
(1) delinquency in payment for electric utility service by a previous occupant of the premises;
(2) failure to pay for merchandise, or charges for non-electric utility service, including but not limited
to insurance policies or home security systems, provided by the electric utility;
(3) failure to pay for a different type or class of electric utility service unless charges for such service
were included on that account’s bill at the time service was initiated;
(4) failure to pay charges arising from an underbilling, except theft of service, more than six months
prior to the current billing;
(5) failure to pay disputed charges, except for the required average billing payment, until a
determination as to the accuracy of the charges has been made by the electric utility or the
commission and the customer has been notified of this determination;
(6) failure to pay charges arising from an underbilling due to any faulty metering, unless the meter has
been tampered with or unless such underbilling charges are due under §25.126 of this title (relating
to Adjustments Due to Non-Compliant Meters and Meter Tampering in Areas Where Customer
Choice Has Been Introduced); or
(7) failure to pay an estimated bill other than a bill rendered pursuant to an approved meter-reading
plan, unless the electric utility is unable to read the meter due to circumstances beyond its control.

disconnection, service shall not be disconnected on holidays or weekends, or the day immediately preceding
a holiday or weekend, unless utility personnel are available on those days to take payments and reconnect
service.
(f) Disconnection due to electric utility abandonment. No electric utility may abandon a customer or a
certified service area without written notice to its customers and all similar neighboring utilities, and approval
from the commission.
(g) Disconnection of ill and disabled. No electric utility may disconnect service at a permanent, individually
metered dwelling unit of a delinquent customer when that customer establishes that disconnection of service
will cause some person residing at that residence to become seriously ill or more seriously ill.
(1) Each time a customer seeks to avoid disconnection of service under this subsection, the customer
must accomplish all of the following by the stated date of disconnection:
(A) have the person’s attending physician (for purposes of this subsection, the term “physician”

order, or other notification that the energy assistance provider is forwarding sufficient payment to continue
service.
(i) Disconnection during extreme weather. An electric utility cannot disconnect a customer anywhere in its
service territory on a day when:
(1) the previous day’s highest temperature did not exceed 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperature
is predicted to remain at or below that level for the next 24 hours, according to the nearest National
Weather Service (NWS) reports; or
(2) the NWS issues a heat advisory for any county in the electric utility’s service territory, or when such
advisory has been issued on any one of the preceding two calendar days.
(j) Disconnection of master-metered apartments. When a bill for electric utility services is delinquent for a
master-metered apartment complex:
(1) The electric utility shall send a notice to the customer as required in subsection (k) of this section.
At the time such notice is issued, the electric utility shall also inform the customer that notice of
possible disconnection will be provided to the tenants of the apartment complex in six days if
payment is not made before that time.
(2) At least six days after providing notice to the customer and at least four days before disconnecting,
the electric utility shall post a minimum of five notices in conspicuous areas in the corridors or other
public places of the apartment complex. Language in the notice shall be in large type and shall read:

(1) In this subsection, “non-submetered master metered multifamily property” means an apartment, a
leased or owner-occupied condominium, or one or more buildings containing at least 10 dwellings
that receive electric utility service that is master metered but not submetered.
(2) An electric utility in an area where customer choice has not been introduced shall send a written
notice of service disconnection to a municipality before disconnecting service to a non-submetered
master metered multifamily property for nonpayment if:
(A) the property is located in the municipality; and
(B) the municipality establishes an authorized representative to receive the notice as described
by paragraph (3) of this subsection.
(3) No later than January 1st of every year, a municipality wishing to receive notice of disconnection
of electric service to a non-submetered master metered multifamily property shall provide the

Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
§25.41. Price to Beat.
(a) Applicability. This section applies to all affiliated retail electric providers (REPs) and transmission and
distribution utilities, except river authorities. This section does not apply to an electric utility subject to
Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.102(c) until the end of the utility’s rate freeze.
(b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the competitiveness of the retail electric market through
the establishment of the price to beat that affiliated REPs must offer to retail customers beginning on January
1, 2002 pursuant to PURA §39.202.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings,
unless the context indicates otherwise:
(1) Affiliated electric utility -- The electric utility from which an affiliated REP was unbundled in
accordance with PURA §39.051.
(2) Competitive retailer -- A REP or a municipally owned utility or distribution cooperative that offers
customer choice in the restructured competitive electric power market or any other entity authorized
to sell electric power and energy at retail in Texas.
(3) Headroom -- The difference between the average price to beat (in cents per kilowatt hour (kWh))
and the sum of the average non-bypassable charges or credits approved by the commission in a
proceeding pursuant to PURA §39.201, or PURA Subchapter G (in cents per kWh) and the
representative power price (in cents per kWh). Headroom may be a positive or negative number.
A separate headroom number shall be calculated for the typical residential customer and the typical
small commercial customer. The calculation for the typical residential customer shall assume 1,000
kWh per month in usage. The calculation of the typical small commercial customer shall assume
35 kilowatts (kW) of demand and 15,000 kWh per month in usage.
(4) Nonaffiliated REP -- Any competitive retailer conducting business in a transmission and
distribution utility’s (TDU’s) certificated service territory that is not affiliated with that TDU unless
the competitive retailer is a successor in interest to a retail electric provider affiliated with that TDU.
(5) Peak demand -- The highest 15-minute or 30-minute demand recorded during a 12-month period.
(6) Price to beat period -- The price to beat period shall be from January 1, 2002 to January 1, 2007.
In a power region outside the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) if customer choice is
introduced before the date the commission certifies the power region pursuant to PURA §39.152(a)
are met, the price to beat period continues, unless changed by the commission in accordance with
PURA Chapter 39, until the later of 60 months after the date customer choice is introduced in the
power region or the date the commission certifies the power region as a qualified power region.
(7) Provider of last resort (POLR) -- As defined in §25.43 of this title (relating to Provider of Last
Resort).
(8) Representative power price -- The simple average of the results of:
(A) a request for proposals (RFP) for full-requirements service of 10% of price to beat load for
a duration of three years expressed in cents per kWh; and
(B) the price resulting from the capacity auctions of the affiliated power generation company
(PGC) required by §25.381 of this title (relating to Capacity Auctions) for baseload
capacity entitlements auctioned in the ERCOT zone where the majority of price to beat
customers reside, expressed in cents per kWh. The calculation of the price resulting from
the capacity auctions shall assume dispatch of 100% of the entitlement and shall use the
most recent auction of a 12-month forward strip of entitlements, or the most recent
aggregated forward 12 months of entitlements. The affiliated REP, at its option, may
conduct an RFP or purchase auction for an amount equivalent to the amount, in MWs, of
the affiliated PGC’s capacity auction for the September 2001 12-month forward strip
baseload entitlements.
(9) Residential customer -- Retail customers classified as residential by the applicable transmission
and distribution utility tariff or, in the absence of classification under a residential rate class, those 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
retail customers that are primarily end users consuming electricity for personal, family or household
purposes and who are not resellers of electricity.
(10) Small commercial customer -- A non-residential retail customer having a peak demand of 1,000
kilowatts (kW) or less. For purposes of this section, the term small commercial customer refers to
a metered point of delivery. Additionally, any non-residential, non-metered point of delivery with
peak demand of less than 1,000 kW shall also be considered a small commercial customer. For
purposes of subsection (i) of this section, unmetered guard and security lights are not considered
small commercial customers unless such an account has historically been treated as a separate
customer for billing purposes.
(11) Transmission and distribution utility -- As defined in §25.5 of this title (relating to Definitions),
except for purposes of this section, this term does not include a river authority.
(d) Price to beat offer.
(1) Beginning with the first billing cycle of the price to beat period and continuing through the last
billing cycle of the price to beat period, an affiliated REP shall make available to residential and
small commercial customers of its affiliated transmission and distribution utility rates that, subject
to the exception listed in subsection (f)(2)(A) of this section, on a bundled basis, are 6.0% less than
the affiliated electric utility’s corresponding average residential and small commercial rates that
were in effect on January 1, 1999, adjusted to reflect the fuel factor determined in accordance with
subsection (f)(3)(D) of this section and adjusted for any base rate reduction as stipulated to by an
electric utility in a proceeding for which a final order had not been issued by January 1, 1999.
(2) Unless specifically required by commission rule, an affiliated REP may only sell electricity to price
to beat customers labeled or marketed as “green,” “renewable,” “interruptible,” “experimental,”
“time of use,” “curtailable,” or “real time,” if and only if such a tariff option existed on January 1,
1999 and only for service under the price to beat rate that was developed from that tariff.
(e) Eligibility for the price to beat. The following criteria shall be used in determining eligibility for the price
to beat:
(1) Residential customers. All current and future residential customers, as defined by this section,
shall be eligible for the price to beat rate(s) for which they meet the eligibility criteria in the
applicable price to beat tariffs for the duration of the price to beat period. An affiliated REP may
not refuse service under the price to beat to a residential customer except as provided by §25.477 of
this title (relating to Refusal of Service). An affiliated REP may not require residential customers
to enter into service agreements with a term of service as a condition of obtaining service under the
price to beat, nor may an affiliated REP provide any inducements to encourage customers to agree
to a term of service in conjunction with service under the price to beat.
(2) Small commercial customers.
(A) A non-residential customer taking service from the affiliated electric utility on December
31, 2001, shall be considered a small commercial customer under this section and shall be
eligible for service under price to beat tariffs if that customer’s peak demand during the 12
consecutive months ending on September 30, 2001, does not exceed 1,000 kilowatts (kW).
A non-residential customer with a peak demand in excess of 1,000 kW during the 12
months ending September 30, 2001, or during the price to beat period, shall no longer be
considered a small commercial customer under this section. However, any non-residential
customer whose peak demand does not exceed 1,000 kW for any period of 12 consecutive
months after it became ineligible to be a small commercial customer under this section
shall be considered a small commercial customer for billing periods going forward for
purposes of this section.
(B) All small commercial customers, as defined by this section, shall be eligible for the price
to beat rate(s) for which they meet the eligibility criteria in the applicable price to beat
tariffs for the duration of the price to beat period. An affiliated REP may not refuse service
under the price to beat to a small commercial customer, except as provided by §25.477 of 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
this title. An affiliated REP may not require small commercial customers to enter into
service agreements with a term of service as a condition to obtaining service under the
price to beat, nor may an affiliated REP provide any inducements to encourage customers
to agree to a term of service in conjunction with service under the price to beat.
(f) Calculation of the price to beat.
(1) Rates to be used for price to beat calculation. The following criteria shall be used in determining
the rates to be used for the price to beat calculation.
(A) Residential. A price to beat rate shall be calculated for each rate and service rider under
which a residential customer was taking service on January 1, 1999, except as approved by
the commission pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. A price to beat rate shall
not be calculated for any new service or tariff option granted to an affiliated electric utility
pursuant to PURA §39.054, or any other rate or tariff option not in effect on January 1,
1999.
(i) Beginning with the first full billing cycle of the price to beat period, residential
customers served by the affiliated REP shall be placed on the price to beat rate
derived from the rate under which they were taking service on December 31,
2001.
(ii) Beginning with the first full billing cycle of the price to beat period, residential
customers served by the affiliated REP who were taking service under a rate for
which a price to beat rate was not developed, shall be placed on the price to beat
rate derived from any eligible residential rate that was or would have been
available to the customer on January 1, 1999.
(iii) New residential customers after December 31, 2001, may choose any price to beat
rate for which they meet the eligibility requirements as detailed in the applicable
price to beat tariff.
(iv) Residential customers who return to the affiliated REP after being served by a
non-affiliated REP may choose any price to beat for which they meet the
eligibility requirements as detailed in the applicable price to beat tariff(s).
(v) Notwithstanding clauses (i)-(iv) of this subparagraph, residential customers may
request service under any price to beat rate for which they are eligible. Selection
of the most advantageous rate shall be the sole responsibility of the residential
customer.
(B) Small commercial. A price to beat rate shall be calculated for each rate and service rider
under which a small commercial customer was taking service on January 1, 1999, except
as approved by the commission pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. A price to
beat rate shall not be calculated for any new service or tariff option granted to an affiliated
electric utility pursuant to PURA §39.054, or for any rate of tariff option not in effect on
January 1, 1999.
(i) Beginning with the first full billing cycle of the price to beat period, small
commercial customers served by the affiliated REP shall be placed on the price to
beat rate derived from the rate under which they were taking service on December
31, 2001.
(ii) Beginning with the first full billing cycle of the price to beat period, small
commercial customers served by the affiliated REP beginning in January of 2002,
who were taking service under a rate for which a price to beat rate was not
developed, shall be placed on a price to beat rate derived from an eligible rate that
was or would have been available to the customer on January 1, 1999.
(iii) New small commercial customers after December 31, 2001, may choose any price
to beat rate for which they meet the eligibility requirements as detailed in the
applicable price to beat tariff.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(iv) Small commercial customers who return to the affiliated REP after being served
by a non-affiliated REP may choose any price to beat rate for which they meet the
eligibility requirements as detailed in the price to beat tariff(s).
(v) Notwithstanding clauses (i)-(iv) of this subparagraph, small commercial
customers may request service under any price to beat tariff for which they are
eligible. Selection of the most advantageous rate shall be the sole responsibility
of the small commercial customer.
(C) An electric utility, on behalf of its future affiliated REP, shall file within 60 days of the
effective date of this section, price to beat tariffs and supporting workpapers for the price
to beat rates developed in accordance with subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph.
At the time of this filing, the affiliated REP may request that a price to beat rate not be
developed from a particular rate of service rider along with justification for the request.
The electric utility shall provide notice to all customers currently taking service under such
rates or service riders of the utility’s request.
(2) Base rate component of price to beat. For the eligible rates identified in paragraph (1) of this
subsection, the affiliated REP shall reduce each base rate component including any purchased power
cost recovery factor (PCRF), in effect for the affiliated electric utility on January 1, 1999, by 6.0%
in order to determine the base rate component of the price to beat, with the following exceptions:
(A) If base rates for the affiliated electric utility were reduced by more than 12% as the result
of a final order issued by the commission after October 1, 1998, then the price to beat shall
be the rate in effect as a result of a settlement approved by the commission after January 1,
1999.
(B) For affiliated REPs operating in a region defined by PURA §39.401, the commission may
reduce rates by less than 6.0% if the commission determines a lesser reduction is necessary
and consistent with the capital requirements needed to develop the infrastructure necessary
to facilitate competition among electric generators.
(C) Except as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, for any affiliated
electric utility that has stipulated to rate reductions in a proceeding for which a final order
had not been issued by January 1, 1999, such rate reductions shall be deducted from the
base rates in effect on January 1, 1999, in addition to the 6.0% reduction. Such rate credits
shall also be applied to the rates of the transmission and distribution utility.
(3) Fuel factor component of price to beat.
(A) Each affiliated electric utility shall file an application to establish one or more fuel factors,
to be effective on January 1, 2002, according to the following schedule:
(i) April 1, 2001 - Reliant Houston Lighting & Power;
(ii) May 1, 2001 - TXU Electric Company;
(iii) June 1, 2001 - Texas-New Mexico Power Company and Central Power & Light
Company;
(iv) July 1, 2001 - Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and West Texas Utilities;
(v) August 1, 2001 - Southwestern Electric Power Company and Southwestern Public
Service Company.
(B) The rate year for the filing shall be calendar year 2002. The affiliated electric utility shall
follow the requirements of §25.237(a)(1), (b), (c) and (e) of this title (relating to Fuel
Factors) and the Fuel Factor Filing Package of November 23, 1993, for the filing of its fuel
factor(s). To the extent that the commission has issued an order for a utility that includes
provisions relating to the price to beat fuel factor, the price to beat fuel factor shall be set
consistent with such an order.
(C) Subject to the limitations in clause (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, affiliated electric
utilities may utilize seasonal fuel factors to reflect the expected differences in the cost of
the market price of electricity throughout the year.
(i) Affiliated electric utilities with seasonal fuel factors in effect on or before March
1, 2001, may request seasonal fuel factors for their residential and small 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
commercial price to beat customers provided the level of seasonality is identical
to that reflected in its commission-approved fuel factors on March 1, 2001.
(ii) Affiliated electric utilities without seasonal fuel factors in effect on or before
March 1, 2001, may request seasonal fuel factors to be applicable to small
commercial price to beat customers only. Any request for seasonal fuel factors
under this clause must demonstrate that the average small commercial customer
will receive, on an annual basis, a 6.0% reduction from the average bundled rate
in effect on January 1, 1999, adjusted for the final fuel factor determined under
subparagraph (D) of this paragraph; provided, however, that a utility subject to
the exception in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection must demonstrate that the
average small commercial customer will receive, on an annual basis, the average
bundled rate in effect as the result of a settlement approved by the commission
after January 1, 1999, adjusted for the final fuel factor determined under
subparagraph (D) of this paragraph.
(D) Each affiliated electric utility shall file additional information on October 1, 2001, to reflect
changes in the price of natural gas for the rate year of 2002. The affiliated electric utility
shall also file information necessary to determine the initial headroom that exists under the
price to beat as a result of the setting of the initial price to beat fuel factor pursuant to this
subparagraph. The adjustment shall be calculated using the following methodology:
(i) For the ten-day period ending on September 15, 2001, an average price shall be
calculated for each month of 2002 in the closing forward NYMEX Henry Hub
natural gas prices, as reported in the Wall Street Journal.
(ii) All other inputs into the calculation of the fuel factors will be the same as those
used to calculate the fuel factor in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph.
(iii) Except for affiliated electric utilities whose base rates were reduced by more than
12% as the result of a final order issued by the commission after October 1, 1998,
the fuel factor(s) to be used at the beginning of the price to beat period shall be
the fuel factor in effect on January 1, 1999, reduced by 6.0%, plus the difference
between the fuel factor(s) established pursuant to this subparagraph and the fuel
factor in effect on January 1, 1999.
(iv) The fuel factor(s) for affiliate electric utilities whose base rates were reduced by
more than 12% as the result of a final order issued by the commission after
October 1, 1998, to be used at the beginning of the price to beat period shall be
the fuel factor(s) established pursuant to this subparagraph.
(E) For a non-generating investor-owned utility with no fuel factor as of January 1, 1999, its
PCRF in effect on January 1, 1999, shall be the equivalent to a fuel factor for purposes of
calculating its price to beat rates and future fuel cost adjustments under subsection (g) of
this section. Upon expiration of a purchased power contract of an affiliated REP unbundled
from such a utility, the affiliated REP may request a change in its PCRF to account for any
difference in purchased power costs.
(g) Adjustments to the price to beat.
(1) Fuel factor adjustments. An affiliated REP may request that the commission adjust the fuel
factor(s) established under subsection (f)(3) of this section upward or downward not more than twice
in a calendar year if the affiliated REP demonstrates that the existing fuel factor(s) do not adequately
reflect significant changes in the market price of natural gas and purchased energy used to serve
retail customers. As part of a filing made pursuant to this paragraph, an affiliated REP may also
request an adjustment to the seasonality imparted to the fuel factor in accordance with subsection
(f)(3)(C) of this section. Alternatively, the commission may, as part of its approval of an adjustment
to the fuel factor, impose a change in the seasonality imparted to the fuel factor. The methodology
for calculating the adjustment to the fuel factor(s) shall be the following:
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(A) For each day of the 20 trading-day period ending no later than two days before the filing
of a fuel factor adjustment application, an average of the closing forward 12-month
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (either in
print or on-line), is calculated.
(B) The average forward price for each trading day calculated in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph will then be averaged to determine a 20 trading-day rolling price.
(C) The percentage difference between the averaged 20 trading-day rolling price calculated
under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph and the averaged price used to calculate
the current fuel factor(s) is calculated. If the current fuel factor was calculated through an
adjustment under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, then the averaged 20 trading-day
rolling price calculated concurrent with that adjustment shall be used. If the percentage
difference is 5.0% or more, then the current fuel factor(s) may be adjusted, unless the filing
is made after November 15 of a calendar year, in which event the percentage difference
must be 10% or more.
(D) If the absolute value of the percentage difference calculated in subparagraph (C) of this
paragraph meets or exceeds 5.0% (or 10% if applicable), then the current fuel factors are
deemed to be unreflective of significant changes in the market price of natural gas and
purchased energy. To adjust the current fuel factor(s), the percentage difference calculated
in subparagraph (C), either positive or negative, is added to one and then multiplied by the
current factor(s). The results are the adjusted fuel factor(s) that will be implemented
according to the procedural schedule in clause (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph:
(i) if no hearing is requested within 15 days after the petition has been filed, a final
order shall be issued within 20 days, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the
petition is filed;
(ii) if a hearing is requested within 15 days after the petition is filed, a final order shall
be issued within 45 days, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the petition is
filed. The 45 day timeline for issuance of an order may be extended upon mutual
agreement of the parties. Such agreement may provide for interim rate relief.
(E) In addition to the adjustment permitted under subparagraphs (A)-(D) of this paragraph, an
affiliated REP may also request an adjustment to the fuel factor if the headroom under the
price to beat decreases as a result of significant changes in the price of purchased energy.
In making a request under this subparagraph:
(i) an affiliated REP shall demonstrate that:
(I) the representative power price has changed such that the headroom under
the price to beat has decreased; and
(II) the adjustment to the fuel factor is necessary to restore the amount of
headroom that existed at the time that the initial price to beat fuel factor
was set by the commission using then current forecasts of the
representative power price.
(III) an affiliated REP making an adjustment under this subparagraph shall
also file the gas price calculation in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this
paragraph for purposes of subsequent adjustments to the fuel factor
based on changes in natural gas prices.
(ii) the commission will issue a final order on an application filed under this
subparagraph within 60 days, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the
application is filed. The 60 day timeline for issuance of an order may be extended
upon mutual agreement of the parties. Such agreement may provide for interim
rate relief.
(F) The commission shall, upon a showing made by an interested party, that a sufficiently
liquid electricity commodity trading hub (or hubs) or index has developed for the affiliated
REP’s relevant geographic or power region, allow an affiliated REP to transition to the use
of electricity commodity futures prices at that hub or index to adjust the fuel factor to 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
adequately reflect significant changes in the price of purchased energy. After the
commission has made a finding that a sufficiently liquid electricity commodity trading hub
or index has developed, the affiliated REP shall be required to perform an additional
adjustment under subparagraphs (A) through (D) or (E) of this paragraph before utilization
of the futures prices at that trading hub or index to change the fuel factor so that a
benchmark electricity price can be established. Subsequent changes to the fuel factor shall
be based on the percentage change in the electricity commodity index using the same
methodology for the natural gas price adjustment under subparagraphs (A) - (D) of this
paragraph.
(2) Adjustment for financial integrity. Upon a finding that an affiliated REP will be unable to
maintain its financial integrity if it complies with subsection (f) of this section, the commission shall
set the affiliated REP’s price to beat at the minimum level that will allow the affiliated REP to
maintain its financial integrity. However, in no event shall the price to beat exceed the level of rates,
on a bundled basis, charged by the affiliated electric utility on September 1, 1999, adjusted for fuel.
(3) True-up adjustment. The commission shall adjust the price to beat following the true-up
proceedings under PURA §39.262. The commission shall consider the following adjustments to the
price to beat on a schedule consistent with the processing of the TDU rate adjustment application
pursuant to §25.263(n) of this title (relating to True-up Proceeding):
(A) Fuel factor adjustment. A 20 trading-day rolling price shall be calculated in accordance
with paragraph (1)(A)-(D) of this subsection. If the 20 trading-day rolling price is less than
the price used to calculate the then-current fuel factor (i.e. The percentage difference is
negative), then the price to beat fuel factor shall be adjusted downward by the percentage
difference in the prices. An adjustment required to be made in accordance with this
subparagraph shall not be considered a request by an affiliated REP under paragraph (1) of
this subsection.
(B) Base rate adjustment. Using the typical residential and small commercial usage
calculations described in subsection (c)(3) of this section, the base rate components of the
price to beat shall be adjusted, either upward or downward, such that the difference between
the average price to beat base rate and the average non-bypassable charges that exist
following the proceeding pursuant to §25.263(n) of this title is the same as existed on
January 1, 2002. Each component of the base rates for each residential price to beat base
rate tariff shall be adjusted in the same proportion in complying with this section. Each
component of the base rates for each small commercial price to beat base rate tariff shall
be adjusted in the same proportion in complying with this section
(C) Filing by affiliated REP. An affiliated REP shall make filings necessary to implement
subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph on a schedule to be determined by the
commission.
(h) Non-price to beat offers.
(1) Offers to residential customers. An affiliated REP may not offer any rates other than the price to
beat rates to residential customers within the affiliated electric utility’s service area until the earlier
of 36 months after the date customer choice is introduced, or when the commission determines that
an affiliated REP has met or exceeded the threshold target for residential customers described in
subsection (i) of this section.
(2) Offers to small commercial customers. An affiliated REP may not offer rates other than the price
to beat rates to small commercial customers until the earlier of 36 months after the date customer
choice is introduced, or when the commission determines that an affiliated REP has met or exceeded
the threshold target for small commercial customers described in subsection (i) of this section.
(3) Offers to aggregated small commercial load. Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection,
an affiliated REP may charge rates different from the price to beat for service to aggregated loads
having an aggregated peak demand in excess of 1,000 kW provided that all affected customers are
commonly owned or are franchisees of the same franchisor.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(A) If aggregated customers whose loads are served by an affiliated REP in accordance with
this subsection disaggregate, those individual customers may resume service under the
applicable price to beat rate(s), provided that those customers meet the eligibility
requirements of subsection (e) of this section.
(B) Any usage removed from the threshold calculation in subsection (i)(1)(B) of this section
due to aggregation shall be added back into the threshold calculation upon disaggregation
of the aggregated load.
(i) Threshold targets.
(1) Calculation of threshold targets.
(A) Residential target. The residential threshold target shall be equal to 40% of the total
number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed by residential customers served by the
affiliated electric utility during the calendar year 2000.
(B) Small commercial target. The small commercial threshold target shall be equal to 40% of
the following difference: the total number of kWh consumed by small commercial
customers served by the affiliated electric utility during the calendar year 2000 minus the
aggregated load served by the affiliated REP that complies with the requirements of
subsection (h)(3) of this section. The kWh associated with a customer who becomes
ineligible for the price to beat because the customer’s peak demand exceeds 1,000 kW shall
also be removed from the threshold target.
(2) Meeting of threshold targets. Upon a showing by the affiliated transmission and distribution utility
that the electric power consumption of the relevant customer group served by nonaffiliated REPs
meets or exceeds the targets determined by the calculation in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the
affiliated REP may offer rates other than the price to beat.
(A) Calculation of residential consumption. The amount of electric power of residential
customers served by nonaffiliated REPs shall equal the number of residential customers
served by nonaffiliated REPs, except customers that the affiliated REP has dropped to the
POLR, times the average annual consumption of residential customers served by the
affiliated utility during the calendar year 2000.
(i) The number of customers served by nonaffiliated REPs shall be determined by
summing the number of customers in the transmission and distribution utility’s
certificated service area with a designated REP other than the affiliated REP in
the registration database maintained by the registration agent. Customers dropped
to the POLR by the affiliated REP shall not count as load served by a nonaffiliated
REP.
(ii) The average annual consumption shall be calculated by dividing the total kWh
consumed by residential customers during the calendar year 2000 by the average
number of residential customers during the calendar year 2000. The average
number of residential customers during the calendar year 2000 shall be calculated
by dividing the sum of the total number of such customers for each month of the
year 2000 by 12.
(B) Calculation of small commercial consumption. The amount of electric power consumed
by small commercial customers served by nonaffiliated REPs shall be determined using
the following criteria, except that customers served by the POLR shall not count as load
served by a nonaffiliated REP:
(i) The amount of electric power of small commercial customers with peak demand
less than 20 kW consumed by nonaffiliated REPs shall be equal to the number of
small commercial customers with peak demand less than 20 kW served by
nonaffiliated REPs times the average annual consumption of small commercial
customers with peak demand less than 20 kW served by the affiliated electric
utility during the calendar year 2000.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(I) The number of customers served by nonaffiliated REPs shall be
determined by summing the number of small commercial customers with
peak demands less than 20 kW served in the transmission and
distribution utility’s certificated service area with a designated REP other
than the affiliated REP in the registration database maintained by the
registration agent.
(II) The average annual consumption shall be calculated by dividing the total
kWh consumed by small commercial customers with peak demand of
less than 20 kW during the calendar year 2000 by the average number of
small commercial customers with peak demand of less than 20 kW
during the calendar year 2000. The average number of small commercial
customers with peak demand of less than 20 kW shall be calculated by
dividing the total number of such customers for each month of 2000 by
12.
(ii) The amount of electric power consumed by small commercial customers with
peak demand in excess of 20 kW shall be the actual usage of those customers
during the calendar year 2000.
(I) If less than 12 months of consumption history exists for such a customer
during the calendar year 2000, the available calendar year 2000 usage
history shall be supplemented with the most recent prior history of
service at that customer’s location for the unavailable months.
(II) For customers with service to a new location, the annual consumption
shall be deemed to be equal to the estimated maximum annual demand
used by the affiliated transmission and distribution utility in sizing the
facilities installed to serve that customer multiplied by the product of
8,760 hours and the average annual load factor for small commercial
customers with peak demand greater than 20 kW for the year 2000.
(j) Prohibition on incentives to switch. An affiliated REP may not provide an incentive to switch to a
nonaffiliated REP, promote any nonaffiliated REP, or exchange customers with any nonaffiliated REP in
order to meet the requirements of subsection (f) of this section. Non-affiliated REPs may not provide an
incentive to return to the price to beat.
(k) Disclosure of price to beat rate. An affiliated retail electric provider shall disclose to customers, the price
to beat in accordance with §25.471 (relating to General Provisions of Customer Protection Rules). In
addition, if an affiliated REP offers a rate greater than the price to beat, the price to beat rate must be disclosed
along with a statement that the customer is eligible for the price to beat. This disclosure must appear on all
written authorizations, Internet authorizations, the electricity facts label and Terms of Service document. It
must also be disclosed during telephone solicitations before the customer authorizes service.
(l) Filing requirements.
(1) On determining that its affiliated retail electric provider has met the requirements of subsection (i)
of this section, an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility shall make a filing with the
commission attesting under oath to the fact that those requirements have been met and that the
restrictions of subsection (h) of this section as well as the true-up in PURA §39.262(e) are no longer
applicable.
(2) An electric utility or transmission and distribution utility shall file a progress report with the
commission after its affiliated REP has met the requirements of subsection (i) of this section using
a 35% threshold target in lieu of a 40% threshold. Such progress reports(s) shall be filed no later
than 30 days after the 35% threshold has been met and shall contain the same information required
in this subsection.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(3) No later than December 31, 2001, each transmission and distribution utility shall determine the
power consumption threshold targets under subsection (i) of this section for residential and small
commercial customers within its certificated service area and shall file this information with the
commission and shall also make this information publicly available through its Internet website.
Each transmission and distribution utility, together with its affiliated REP, shall update the small
commercial power consumption threshold as needed to reflect additional small commercial load that
has met the requirements of subsection (h)(3) of this section and therefore is appropriately removed
from the calculation of the threshold target. Concurrent with this update, the transmission and
distribution utility, together with its affiliated REP, shall provide, for each group of aggregated
customers that have been removed from the calculation of the threshold target, the customers’
names, electric service identifiers, size of the customers’ loads (individually and in the aggregate),
and how the customers meet the requirements of subsection (h)(3) of this section. Such information
may be filed under confidential seal. All certificated REPs shall be deemed to have standing to
review such filings.
(4) Any application filed pursuant to this subsection shall contain the following information:
(A) a detailed explanation of how the relevant customer group has met or exceeded the
threshold consumption targets in subsection (i) of this section;
(B) calculation of the power consumption threshold target under subsection (i) of this section
for the relevant customer group and the date such target was met;
(C) verification of the meeting of the threshold target in the following manner:
(i) for the residential customer class, independent verification from the registration
agent verifying the number of customers in the residential customer class within
the transmission and distribution utility’s certificated service area that are
committed to be served by non-affiliated REPs.
(ii) for the small commercial class, an affidavit detailing the number of customers in
the small commercial class with peak demand below 20 kW within the
transmission and distribution utility’s certificated service area committed to be
served by non-affiliated REPs and the customers with peak demand in excess of
20 kW with their actual usage calculated in accordance with subsection
(i)(2)(B)(ii) of this section within the transmission and distribution utility’s
certificated service area that are committed to be served by non-affiliated REPs.
(iii) For purposes of this subsection, a residential and small commercial customer has
committed to be served by a nonaffiliated retail electric provider if the registration
agent has received a switch request for that customer and any mandated
cancellation period pursuant to applicable commission rule has expired.
(5) The commission staff shall review all applications filed under this subsection and shall make a
recommendation to the commission within ten days after the application is filed to approve or reject
the application. If a filing has insufficient information from which the commission can make a
determination, the commission may reject the filing without prejudice for refiling the application.
The commission shall issue an order approving or rejecting the application within 30 days after the
application is filed. An electric utility or transmission and distribution utility filing an application
under this subsection shall not charge rates different from the price to beat until the earlier of 36
months after the date customer choice is introduced or the date such application has been approved
by the commission.

Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
§25.43. Provider of Last Resort (POLR).
(a) Purpose. This section establishes the requirements for Provider of Last Resort (POLR) service and ensures
that it is available to any requesting retail customer and any retail customer who is transferred to another
retail electric provider (REP) by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) because the customer’s
REP failed to provide service to the customer or failed to meet its obligations to the independent organization.
(b) Application. The provisions of this section relating to the selection of REPs providing POLR service apply
to all REPs that are serving retail customers in transmission and distribution utility (TDU) service areas. This
section does not apply when an electric cooperative or a municipally owned utility (MOU) designates a POLR
provider for its certificated service area. However, this section is applicable when an electric cooperative
delegates its authority to the commission in accordance with subsection (r) of this section to select a POLR
provider for the electric cooperative’s service area. All filings made with the commission pursuant to this
section, including filings subject to a claim of confidentiality, must be filed with the commission’s Filing
Clerk in accordance with the commission’s Procedural Rules, Chapter 22, Subchapter E, of this title (relating
to Pleadings and other Documents).
(c) Definitions. The following terms when used in this section have the following meanings, unless the context
indicates otherwise:
(1) Affiliate -- As defined in §25.107 of this title (relating to Certification of Retail Electric Providers
(REPs).
(2) Basic firm service -- Electric service that is not subject to interruption for economic reasons and
that does not include value-added options offered in the competitive market. Basic firm service
excludes, among other competitively offered options, emergency or back-up service, and stand-by
service. For purposes of this definition, the phrase “interruption for economic reasons” does not
mean disconnection for non-payment.
(3) Billing cycle -- A period bounded by a start date and stop date that REPs and TDUs use to determine
when a customer used electric service.
(4) Billing month -- Generally a calendar accounting period (approximately 30 days) for recording
revenue, which may or may not coincide with the period a customer’s consumption is recorded
through the customer’s meter.
(5) Business day -- As defined by the ERCOT Protocols.
(6) Large non-residential customer -- A non-residential customer who had a peak demand in the
previous 12-month period at or above one megawatt (MW).
(7) Large service provider (LSP) -- A REP that is designated to provide POLR service pursuant to
subsection (j) of this section.
(8) Market-based product – A month-to-month product that is either offered to or matches the rate of
a product offered to non-POLR customers of the REP for the same TDU territory and customer
class. A month-to-month contract may not contain a termination fee or penalty. For purposes of
this section, a rate for residential customers that is derived by applying a positive or negative
multiplier to the rate described in subsection (m)(2) of this section is not a market-based product.
(9) Mass transition -- The transfer of customers as represented by ESI IDs from a REP to one or more
POLR providers pursuant to a transaction initiated by the independent organization that carries the
mass transition (TS) code or other code designated by the independent organization.
(10) Medium non-residential customer -- A non-residential retail customer who had a peak demand in
the previous 12-month period of 50 kilowatt (kW) or greater, but less than 1,000 kW.
(11) POLR area -- The service area of a TDU in an area where customer choice is in effect.
(12) POLR provider -- A volunteer retail electric provider (VREP) or LSP that may be required to
provide POLR service pursuant to this section.
(13) Residential customer -- A retail customer classified as residential by the applicable TDU tariff or,
in the absence of classification under a tariff, a retail customer who purchases electricity for
personal, family, or household purposes.

(2) For the purpose of POLR service, there are four classes of customers: residential, small nonresidential, medium non-residential, and large non-residential.
(3) A VREP or LSP may be designated to serve any or all of the four customer classes in a POLR area.
(4) A POLR provider must offer a basic, standard retail service package to customers it is designated
to serve, which is limited to:
(A) Basic firm service; and
(B)Call center facilities available for customer inquiries.
(5) A POLR provider must, in accordance with §25.108 of this title (relating to Financial Standards for
Retail Electric Providers Regarding the Billing and Collection of Transition Charges), fulfill billing
and collection duties for REPs that have defaulted on payments to the servicer of transition bonds
or to TDUs.
(6) Each LSP’s customer billing for residential customers taking POLR service under a rate prescribed
by subsection (m)(2) of this section must contain notice to the customer that other competitive
products or services may be available from the LSP or another REP. The notice must also include
contact information for the LSP, and the Power to Choose website, and must include a notice from
the commission in the form of a bill insert or a bill message with the header “An Important Message
from the Public Utility Commission Regarding Your Electric Service” addressing why the customer
has been transitioned to an LSP, a description of the purpose and nature of POLR service, and
explaining that more information on competitive markets can be found at www.powertochoose.org,
or toll-free at 1-866-PWR-4-TEX (1-866-797-4839).
(e) Standards of service.
(1) An LSP designated to serve a class in a given POLR area must serve any eligible customer
requesting POLR service or assigned to the LSP pursuant to a mass transition in accordance with
the Standard Terms of Service in subsection (f)(1) of this section for the provider customer’s class.
However, in lieu of providing terms of service to a transitioned customer under subsection (f) of this
section and under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section an LSP may at its discretion
serve the customer pursuant to a market-based month-to-month product, provided it serves all
transitioned customers in the same class and POLR area pursuant to the product.
(2) A POLR provider must abide by the applicable customer protection rules as provided for under
Subchapter R of this chapter (relating to Customer Protection Rules for Retail Electric Service),
except that if there is an inconsistency or conflict between this section and Subchapter R of this
chapter, the provisions of this section apply. However, for the medium non-residential customer
class, the customer protection rules as provided for under Subchapter R of this chapter do not apply,
except for §25.481 of this title (relating to Unauthorized Charges), §25.485(a)-(b) of this title
(relating to Customer Access and Complaint Handling), and §25.495 of this title (relating to
Unauthorized Change of Retail Electric Provider).
(3) An LSP that has received commission approval to designate one of its affiliates to provide POLR
service on behalf of the LSP pursuant to subsection (k) of this section must retain responsibility for
the provision of POLR service by the LSP affiliate and remains liable for violations of applicable
laws and commission rules and all financial obligations of the LSP affiliate associated with the
provisioning of POLR service on its behalf by the LSP affiliate.

be updated as required under §25.475(f) of this title (relating to General Retail Electric Provider
Requirements and Information Disclosures to Residential and Small Commercial Customers).
(g) General description of POLR service provider selection process.
(1) Each REP must provide information to the commission in accordance with subsection (h)(1) of this
section. Based on this information, the commission’s designated representative will designate REPs
that are eligible to serve as POLR providers in areas of the state in which customer choice is in
effect, except that the commission will not designate POLR providers in the service areas of MOUs
or electric cooperatives unless an electric cooperative has delegated to the commission its authority
to designate the POLR provider, in accordance with subsection (r) of this section.
(2) POLR providers must serve two-year terms. The initial term for POLR service in areas of the state
where retail choice is not in effect as of the effective date of the rule must be set at the time POLR
providers are initially selected in such areas.
(h) REP eligibility to serve as a POLR provider. In each even-numbered year, the commission will determine
the eligibility of certified REPs to serve as POLR providers for a term scheduled to commence in January of
the next year.
(1) Each REP must provide information to the commission necessary to establish its eligibility to serve
as a POLR provider for the next term. A REP must file, by July 10th of each even-numbered year,
by service area, information on the classes of customers it provides service to, and for each customer
class, the number of ESI IDs the REP serves and the retail sales in megawatt-hours for the annual
period ending March 31 of the current year. As part of that filing, a REP may request that the
commission designate one of its affiliates to provide POLR service on its behalf pursuant to
subsection (k) of this section in the event that the REP is designated as an LSP. The independent
organization must provide to the commission the total number of ESI ID and total MWh data for
each class. Each REP must also provide information on its technical capability and financial ability
to provide service to additional customers in a mass transition. The commission’s determination
regarding eligibility of a REP to serve as POLR provider under the provisions of this section will
not be considered confidential information.
(2) Eligibility to be designated as a POLR provider is specific to each POLR area and customer class.
A REP is eligible to be designated a POLR provider for a particular customer class in a POLR area,
unless:
(A) A proceeding to revoke or suspend the REP’s certificate is pending at the commission, the
REP’s certificate has been suspended or revoked by the commission, or the REP’s
certificate is deemed suspended pursuant to §25.107 of this title (relating to Certification
of Retail Electric Providers (REPs));
(B) The sum of the numeric portion of the REP’s percentage of ESI IDs served and percentage
of retail sales by MWhs in the POLR area, for the particular class, is less than 1.0;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
(C) The commission does not reasonably expect the REP to be able to meet the criteria set forth
in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph during the entirety of the term;
(D) On the date of the commencement of the term, the REP or its predecessor will not have
served customers in Texas for at least 18 months;
(E) The REP does not serve the applicable customer class, or does not have an executed
delivery service agreement with the service area TDU;
(F) The REP is certificated as an Option 2 REP under §25.107 of this title;
(G) The REP’s customers are limited to its own affiliates;
(H) A REP files an affidavit stating that it does not serve small or medium non-residential
customers, except for the low-usage sites of the REP’s large non-residential customers, or
commonly owned or franchised affiliates of the REP’s large non-residential customers and
opts out of eligibility for either, or both of the small or medium non-residential customer
classes; or
(I) The REP does not meet minimum financial, technical and managerial qualifications
established by the commission under §25.107 of this title.
(3) For each term, the commission will publish the names of all REPs eligible to serve as a POLR
provider under this section for each customer class in each POLR area and will provide notice to
REPs determined to be eligible to serve as a POLR provider. A REP may challenge its eligibility
determination within five business days of the notice of eligibility by filing with the commission
additional documentation that includes the specific data, the specific calculation, and a specific
explanation that clearly illustrate and prove the REP’s assertion. Commission staff will verify the
additional documentation and, if accurate, reassess the REP’s eligibility. Commission staff will
notify the REP of any change in eligibility status within 10 business days of the receipt of the
additional documentation. A REP may then appeal to the commission through a contested case if
the REP does not agree with the staff determination of eligibility. The contested status will not
delay the designation of POLR providers.
(4) A standard form may be created by the commission for REPs to use in filing information concerning
their eligibility to serve as a POLR provider.
(5) If ERCOT or a TDU has reason to believe that a REP is no longer capable of performing POLR
responsibilities, ERCOT or the TDU must make a filing with the commission detailing the basis for
its concerns and must provide a copy of the filing to the REP that is the subject of the filing. If the
filing contains confidential information, ERCOT or the TDU must file the confidential information
in accordance with §22.71 of this title (relating to Filing of Pleadings, Documents, and Other
Materials). Commission staff will review the filing, and will request that the REP demonstrate that
it still meets the qualifications to provide the service. The commission staff may initiate a
proceeding with the commission to disqualify the REP from providing POLR service. No ESI IDs
will be assigned to a POLR provider after the commission staff initiates a proceeding to disqualify
the POLR provider, unless the commission by order confirms the POLR provider’s designation.
(i) VREP list. Based on the information provided in accordance with this subsection and subsection (h) of this
section, the commission will post the names of VREPs on its webpage, including the aggregate customer
count offered by VREPs. A REP may submit a request to be a VREP no earlier than June 1, and no later
than July 31, of each even-numbered year unless otherwise determined by the executive director. This filing
must include a description of the REP’s capabilities to serve additional customers as well as the REP’s current
financial condition in enough detail to demonstrate that the REP is capable of absorbing a mass transition of
customers without technically or financially distressing the REP and the specific information set out in this
subsection. The commission’s determination regarding eligibility of a REP to serve as a VREP, under the
provisions of this section, will not be considered confidential information.
(1) A VREP must provide to the commission the name of the REP, the appropriate contact person with
current contact information, which customer classes the REP is willing to serve within each POLR
area, and the number of ESI IDs the REP is willing to serve by customer class and POLR area in
each transition event. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
(2) A REP that has met the eligibility requirements of subsection (h) of this section and provided the
additional information set out in this subsection is eligible for designation as a VREP.
(3) Commission staff will make an initial determination of the REPs that are to serve as a VREP for
each customer class in each POLR area and publish their names. A REP may challenge its eligibility
determination within five business days of the notice of eligibility by submitting to commission staff
additional evidence of its capability to serve as a VREP. Commission staff will reassess the REP’s
eligibility and notify the REP of any change in eligibility status within 10 business days of the
receipt of the additional documentation. A REP may then appeal to the commission through a
contested case if the REP does not agree with the staff determination of eligibility. The contested
status will not delay the designation of VREPs.
(4) A VREP may file a request at any time to be removed from the VREP list or to modify the number
of ESI IDs that it is willing to serve as a VREP. If the request is to increase the number of ESI IDs,
it must provide information to demonstrate that it is capable of serving the additional ESI IDs, and
the commission staff will make an initial determination, which is subject to an appeal to the
commission, in accordance with the timelines specified in paragraph (3) of this subsection. If the
request is to decrease the number of ESI IDs, the request must be effective five calendar days after
the request is filed with the commission; however, after the request becomes effective the VREP
must continue to serve ESI IDs previously acquired through a mass transition event as well as ESI
IDs the VREP acquires from a mass transition event that occurs during the five-day notice period.
If in a mass transition a VREP is able to acquire more customers than it originally volunteered to
serve, the VREP may work with commission staff and ERCOT to increase its designation. Changes
approved by commission staff will be communicated to ERCOT and must be implemented for the
current allocation if possible.
(5) ERCOT or a TDU may challenge a VREP’s eligibility. If ERCOT or a TDU has reason to believe
that a REP is no longer capable of performing VREP responsibilities, ERCOT or the TDU must
make a filing with the commission detailing the basis for its concerns and must provide a copy of
the filing to the REP that is the subject of the filing. If the filing contains confidential information,
ERCOT or the TDU must file it in accordance with §25.71 of this title (relating to General
Procedures, Requirements and Penalties). Commission staff will review the filing of ERCOT and
if commission staff concludes that the REP should no longer provide VREP service, it will request
that the REP demonstrate that it still meets the qualifications to provide the service. The commission
staff may initiate a proceeding with the commission to disqualify the REP from providing VREP
service. No ESI IDs will be assigned to a VREP after the commission staff initiates a proceeding
to disqualify the VREP, unless the commission by order confirms the VREP’s designation.

Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
(j) LSPs. This subsection governs the selection and service of REPs as LSPs.
(1) The REPs eligible to serve as LSPs must be determined based on the information provided by REPs
in accordance with subsection (h) of this section. However, for new TDU service areas that are
transitioned to competition, the transition to competition plan approved by the commission may
govern the selection of LSPs to serve as POLR providers.
(2) In each POLR area, for each customer class, the commission will designate up to 15 LSPs. The
eligible REPs that have the greatest market share based upon retail sales in megawatt-hours, by
customer class and POLR area must be designated as LSPs. Commission staff will designate the
LSPs by October 15th of each even-numbered year, based upon the data submitted to the
commission under subsection (h) of this section. Designation as a VREP does not affect a REP’s
eligibility to also serve as an LSP.
(3) For the purpose of calculating the POLR rate for each customer class in each POLR area, an EFL
must be completed by the LSP that has the greatest market share in accordance with paragraph (2)
of this subsection. The Electricity Facts Label (EFL) must be supplied to commission staff
electronically for placement on the commission webpage by the 10th of each month. Where REPspecific information is required to be inserted in the EFL, the LSP supplying the EFL must note that
such information is REP-specific.
(4) An LSP serving transitioned residential and small non-residential customers under a rate prescribed
by subsection (m)(2) of this section must move such customers to a market-based month-to-month
product, with pricing for such product to be effective no later than either the 61st day of service by
the LSP or beginning with the customer’s next billing cycle date following the 60th day of service
by the LSP. For each transition event, all such transitioned customers in the same class and POLR
area must be served pursuant to the same product terms, except for those customers specified in
subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
(A) The notice required by §25.475(d) of this title to inform the customers of the change to a marketbased month-to-month product may be included with the notice required by subsection (t)(3) of this
section or may be provided 14 days in advance of the change. If the §25.475(d) notice is included
with the notice required by subsection (t)(3) of this section, the LSP may state that either or both the
terms of service document and EFL for the market-based month-to-month product will be provided
at a later time, but no later than 14 days before their effective date.
(B) The LSP is not required to transfer to a market-based product any transitioned customer who is
delinquent in payment of any charges for POLR service to such LSP as of the 60th day of service.
If such a customer becomes current in payments to the LSP, the LSP must move the customer to a
market-based month-to-month product as described in this paragraph on the next billing cycle that
occurs five business days after the customer becomes current. If the LSP does not plan to move
customers who are delinquent in payment of any charges for POLR service as of the 60th day of
service to a market-based month-to-month product, the LSP must inform the customer of that
potential outcome in the notice provided to comply with §25.475(d) of this title.
(5) Upon a request from an LSP and a showing that the LSP will be unable to maintain its financial
integrity if additional customers are transferred to it under this section, the commission may relieve
an LSP from a transfer of additional customers. The LSP must continue providing continuous
service until the commission issues an order relieving it of this responsibility. In the event the
requesting LSP is relieved of its responsibility, the commission staff designee will, with 90 days’
notice, designate the next eligible REP, if any, as an LSP, based upon the criteria in this subsection.
(k) Designation of an LSP affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP.
(1) An LSP may request the commission designate an LSP affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf
of the LSP either with the LSP’s filing under subsection (h) of this section or as a separate filing in
the current term project. The filing must be made at least 30 days prior to the date when the LSP
affiliate is to begin providing POLR service on behalf of the LSP. To be eligible to provide POLR
service on behalf of an LSP, the LSP affiliate must be certificated to provide retail electric service; 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
have an executed delivery service agreement with the service area TDU; and meet the requirements
of subsection (h)(2) of this section, with the exception of subsection (h)(2)(B), (C), (D), and (E) of
this section as related to serving customers in the applicable customer class.
(2) The request must include the name and certificate number of the LSP affiliate, information
demonstrating the affiliation between the LSP and the LSP affiliate, and a certified agreement from
an officer of the LSP affiliate stating that the LSP affiliate agrees to provide POLR service on behalf
of the LSP. The request must also include an affidavit from an officer of the LSP stating that the
LSP will be responsible and indemnify any affected parties for all financial obligations of the LSP
affiliate associated with the provisioning of POLR service on behalf of the LSP in the event that the
LSP affiliate defaults or otherwise does not fulfill such financial obligations.
(3) Commission staff will make an initial determination of the eligibility of the LSP affiliate to provide
POLR service on behalf of an LSP and publish their names. The LSP or LSP affiliate may challenge
commission staff’s eligibility determination within five business days of the notice of eligibility by
submitting to commission staff additional evidence of its capability to provide POLR service on
behalf of the LSP. Commission staff will reassess the LSP affiliate’s eligibility and notify the LSP
and LSP affiliate of any change in eligibility status within 10 business days of the receipt of the
additional documentation. If the LSP or LSP affiliate does not agree with staff’s determination of
eligibility, either or both may then appeal the determination to the commission through a contested
case. The LSP must provide POLR service during the pendency of the contested case.
(4) ERCOT or a TDU may challenge an LSP affiliate’s eligibility to provide POLR service on behalf
of an LSP. If ERCOT or a TDU has reason to believe that an LSP affiliate is not eligible or is not
performing POLR responsibilities on behalf of an LSP, ERCOT or the TDU must make a filing with
the commission detailing the basis for its concerns and must provide a copy of the filing to the LSP
and the LSP affiliate that are the subject of the filing. If the filing contains confidential information,
ERCOT or the TDU must file it in accordance with §25.71 of this title (relating to General
Procedures, Requirements and Penalties). Commission staff will review the filing and if
commission staff concludes that the LSP affiliate should not be allowed to provide POLR service
on behalf of the LSP, it will request that the LSP affiliate demonstrate that it has the capability. The
commission staff will review the LSP affiliate’s filing and may initiate a proceeding with the
commission to disqualify the LSP affiliate from providing POLR service. The LSP affiliate may
continue providing POLR service to ESI IDs currently receiving the service during the pendency of
the proceeding; however, the LSP must immediately assume responsibility to provide service under
this section to customers who request POLR service, or are transferred to POLR service through a
mass transition, during the pendency of the proceeding.
(5) Designation of an affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP must not change the number
of ESI IDs served or the retail sales in megawatt-hours for the LSP for the reporting period nor does
such designation relieve the LSP of its POLR service obligations in the event that the LSP affiliate
fails to provide POLR service in accordance with the commission rules.
(6) The designated LSP affiliate must provide POLR service and all reports as required by the
commission’s rules on behalf of the LSP.
(7) The methodology used by a designated LSP affiliate to calculate POLR rates must be consistent
with the methodology used to calculate LSP POLR rates in subsection (m) of this section.
(8) If an LSP affiliate designated to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP cannot meet or fails to
meet the POLR service requirements in applicable laws and Commission rules, the LSP must
provide POLR service to any ESI IDs currently receiving the service from the LSP affiliate and to
ESI IDs in a future mass transition or upon customer request.
(9) An LSP may elect to reassume provisioning of POLR service from the LSP affiliate by filing a
reversion notice with the commission and notifying ERCOT at least 30 days in advance.
(l) Mass transition of customers to POLR providers. The transfer of customers to POLR providers must be
consistent with this subsection. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
(1) ERCOT must first transfer customers to VREPs, up to the number of ESI IDs that each VREP has
offered to serve for each customer class in the POLR area. ERCOT must use the VREP list to assign
ESI IDs to the VREPs in a non-discriminatory manner, before assigning customers to the LSPs. A
VREP must not be assigned more ESI IDs than it has indicated it is willing to serve pursuant to
subsection (i) of this section. To ensure non-discriminatory assignment of ESI IDs to the VREPs,
ERCOT must:
(A) Sort ESI IDs by POLR area;
(B) Sort ESI IDs by customer class;
(C) Sort ESI IDs numerically;
(D) Sort VREPs numerically by randomly generated number; and
(E) Assign ESI IDs in numerical order to VREPs, in the order determined in subparagraph (D)
of this paragraph, in accordance with the number of ESI IDs each VREP indicated a
willingness to serve pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. If the number of ESI IDs is
less than the total that the VREPs indicated that they are willing to serve, each VREP must
be assigned an equal number of ESI IDs, up to the number that each VREP indicated it was
willing to serve for a given class and POLR area.
(2) If the number of ESI IDs exceeds the amount the VREPs are designated to serve, ERCOT must
assign remaining ESI IDs to LSPs in a non-discriminatory fashion, in accordance with their
percentage of market share based upon retail sales in megawatt-hours, on a random basis within a
class and POLR area, except that a VREP that is also an LSP that volunteers to serve at least 1% of
its market share for a class of customers in a POLR area must be exempt from the LSP allocation
up to 1% of the class and POLR area. To ensure non-discriminatory assignment of ESI IDs to the
LSPs, ERCOT must:
(A) Sort the ESI IDs in excess of the allocation to VREPs, by POLR area;
(B) Sort ESI IDs in excess of the allocation to VREPs, by customer class;
(C) Sort ESI IDs in excess of the allocation to VREPs, numerically;
(D) Sort LSPs, except LSPs that volunteered to serve 1% of their market share as a VREP,
numerically by MWhs served;
(E) Assign ESI IDs that represent no more than 1% of the total market for that POLR area and
customer class less the ESI IDs assigned to VREPs that volunteered to serve at least 1% of
their market share for each POLR area and customer class in numerical order to LSPs
designated in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, in proportion to the percentage of MWhs
served by each LSP to the total MWhs served by all LSPs;
(F) Sort LSPs, including any LSPs previously excluded under subparagraph (D) of this
paragraph; and
(G) Assign all remaining ESI IDs in numerical order to LSPs in proportion to the percentage
of MWhs served by each LSP to the total MWhs served by all LSPs.
(3) Each mass transition must be treated as a separate event.
(m) Rates applicable to POLR service.
(1) A VREP must provide service to customers using a market-based, month-to-month product. The
VREP must use the same market-based, month-to-month product for all customers in a mass
transition that are in the same class and POLR area.
(2) Subparagraphs (A)-(C) of this paragraph establish the maximum rate for POLR service charged by
an LSP. An LSP may charge a rate less than the maximum rate if it charges the lower rate to all
customers in a mass transition that are in the same class and POLR area.
(A) Residential customers. The LSP rate for the residential customer class must be
determined by the following formula:
LSP rate (in $ per kWh) = (Non-bypassable charges + LSP customer charge + LSP energy charge) / kWh
used
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
Where:
(i) Non-bypassable charges must be all TDU charges and credits for the appropriate
customer class in the applicable service territory and other charges including
ERCOT administrative charges, nodal fees or surcharges, reliability unit
commitment (RUC) capacity short charges attributable to LSP load, and
applicable taxes from various taxing or regulatory authorities, multiplied by the
level of kWh and kW used, where appropriate.
(ii) LSP customer charge must be $0.09 per kWh.
(iii) Beginning on the 10th of each month, an LSP energy charge must be the average
of the actual Real-Time Settlement Point Prices (RTSPPs) for the applicable load
zone for the preceding calendar month (the historical average RTSPP) multiplied
by the number of kWhs the customer used during that billing period and further
multiplied by 120%. The LSP energy charge must not exceed 160%of the
preceding calendar month’s LSP energy charge. The applicable load zone will be
the load zone located partially or wholly in the customer’s TDU service territory
with the highest average under the historical average RTSPP calculation.
(iv) “Number of kWhs the customer used” is based on usage data provided to the
POLR by the TDU.
(B)Small and medium non-residential customers. The LSP rate for the small and medium nonresidential customer classes must be determined by the following formula:
LSP rate (in $ per kWh) = (Non-bypassable charges + LSP customer charge + LSP energy charge) / kWh
used
Where:
(i) Non-bypassable charges must be all TDU charges and credits for the appropriate
customer class in the applicable service territory, and other charges including
ERCOT administrative charges, nodal fees or surcharges, RUC capacity short
charges attributable to LSP load, and applicable taxes from various taxing or
regulatory authorities, multiplied by the level of kWh and kW used, where
appropriate.
(ii) LSP customer charge must be $0.09per kWh.
(iii) Beginning on the 10th of each month, LSP energy charge must be the average of
the actual RTSPPs for the applicable load zone for the preceding calendar month
multiplied by the number of kWhs the customer used during that billing period
and further multiplied by 125%. The LSP energy charge must not exceed 160%
of the preceding calendar month’s LSP energy charge. The applicable load zone
will be the load zone located partially or wholly in the customer’s TDU service
territory with the highest average under the historical average RTSPP calculation.
(iv) “Number of kWhs the customer used” is based on usage data provided to the
POLR by the TDU.
(C) Large non-residential customers. The LSP rate for the large non-residential customer
class must be determined by the following formula:
LSP rate (in $ per kWh) = (Non-bypassable charges + LSP customer charge + LSP demand charge + LSP
energy charge) / kWh used
Where:
(i) Non-bypassable charges must be all TDU charges and credits for the appropriate
customer class in the applicable service territory, and other charges including
ERCOT administrative charges, nodal fees or surcharges, RUC capacity short 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
charges attributable to LSP load, and applicable taxes from various taxing or
regulatory authorities, multiplied by the level of kWh and KW used, where
appropriate.
(ii) LSP customer charge must be $2,897.00 per month.
(iii) LSP demand charge must be $6.00 per kW, per month.
(iv) LSP energy charge must be the appropriate RTSPP, determined on the basis of 15-
minute intervals, for the customer multiplied by 125%, multiplied by the level of
kilowatt-hours used. The energy charge must have a floor of $7.25 per MWh.
(3) If in response to a complaint or upon its own investigation, the commission determines that an LSP
failed to charge the appropriate rate prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subsection, and as a result
overcharged its customers, the LSP must issue refunds to the specific customers who were
overcharged.
(4) On a showing of good cause by an affected person, the commission may direct an LSP to adjust the
rate prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subsection, if necessary to ensure that the rate is consistent
with prevailing market conditions. Notwithstanding any other commission rule to the contrary, such
rates may be adjusted on an interim basis for good cause shown and after at least 10 business days’
notice and an opportunity for hearing on the request for interim relief. Any adjusted rate must be
applicable to all LSPs charging the rate prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subsection to the specific
customer class, within the POLR area that is subject to the adjustment.
(5) For transitioned customers, the customer and demand charges associated with the rate prescribed by
paragraph (3) of this subsection must be pro-rated for partial month usage if a large non-residential
customer switches from the LSP to a REP of choice.
(n) Challenges to customer assignments. A POLR provider is not obligated to serve a customer within a
customer class or a POLR area for which the REP is not designated as a POLR provider, after a successful
challenge of the customer assignment. A POLR provider must use the ERCOT market variance resolution
tool to challenge a customer class assignment with the TDU. The TDU must make the final determination
based upon historical usage data and not premise type. If the customer class assignment is changed and a
different POLR provider for the customer is determined appropriate, the customer must then be served by
the appropriate POLR provider. Back dated transactions may be used to correct the POLR assignment.
(o) Limitation on liability. A POLR provider must make reasonable provisions to provide service under this
section to any ESI IDs currently receiving the service and to ESI IDs obtained in a future mass transition or
served upon customer request; however, liabilities not excused by reason of force majeure or otherwise must
be limited to direct, actual damages.
(1) Neither the customer nor the POLR provider must be liable to the other for consequential, incidental,
punitive, exemplary, or indirect damages. These limitations apply without regard to the cause of
any liability or damage.
(2) In no event will ERCOT or a POLR provider be liable for damages to any REP, whether under tort,
contract or any other theory of legal liability, for transitioning or attempting to transition a customer
from such REP to the POLR provider to carry out this section, or for marketing, offering or
providing competitive retail electric service to a customer taking service under this section from the
POLR provider.
(p) REP obligations in a transition of customers to POLR service.
(1) A customer may initiate service with an LSP by requesting such service at the rate prescribed by
subsection (m)(2) of this section with any LSP that is designated to serve the requesting customer’s
customer class within the requesting customer’s service area. An LSP cannot refuse a customer’s
request to make arrangements for POLR service, except as otherwise permitted under this title.
(2) The POLR provider is responsible for obtaining resources and services needed to serve a customer
once it has been notified that it is serving that customer. The customer is responsible for charges
for service under this section at the rate in effect at that time.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
(3) If a REP terminates service to a customer, or transitions a customer to a POLR provider, the REP is
financially responsible for the resources and services used to serve the customer until it notifies the
independent organization of the termination or transition of the service and the transfer to the POLR
provider is complete.
(4) The POLR provider is financially responsible for all costs of providing electricity to customers from
the time the transfer or initiation of service is complete until such time as the customer ceases taking
service under this section.
(5) A defaulting REP whose customers are subject to a mass transition event must return the customers’
deposits within seven calendar days of the initiation of the transition.
(6) ERCOT must create a single standard file format and a standard set of customer billing contact data
elements that, in the event of a mass transition, must be used by the exiting REP and the POLRs to
send and receive customer billing contact information. The process, as developed by ERCOT must
be tested on a periodic basis. Each REP must submit timely, accurate, and complete files, as required
by ERCOT in a mass transition event, as well as for periodic testing. The commission will establish
a procedure for the verification of customer information submitted by REPs to ERCOT. ERCOT
must notify the commission if any REP fails to comply with the reporting requirements in this
subsection.
(7) When customers are to be transitioned or assigned to a POLR provider, the POLR provider may
request usage and demand data, and customer contact information including email, telephone
number, and address from the appropriate TDU and from ERCOT, once the transition to the POLR
provider has been initiated. Customer proprietary information provided to a POLR provider in
accordance with this section must be treated as confidential and must only be used for mass
transition related purposes.
(8) Information from the TDU and ERCOT to the POLR providers must be provided in Texas SET
format when Texas SET transactions are available. However, the TDU or ERCOT may supplement
the information to the POLR providers in other formats to expedite the transition. The transfer of
information in accordance with this section must not constitute a violation of the customer protection
rules that address confidentiality.
(9) A POLR provider may require a deposit from a customer that has been transitioned to the POLR
provider to continue to serve the customer. Despite the lack of a deposit, the POLR provider is
obligated to serve the customer transitioned or assigned to it, beginning on the service initiation date
of the transition or assignment, and continuing until such time as any disconnection request is
effectuated by the TDU. A POLR provider may make the request for deposit before it begins serving
the customer, but the POLR provider must begin providing service to the customer even if the
service initiation date is before it receives the deposit - if any deposit is required. A POLR provider
must not disconnect the customer until the appropriate time period to submit the deposit has elapsed.
For the large non-residential customer class, a POLR provider may require a deposit to be provided
in three calendar days. For the residential customer class, the POLR provider may require a deposit
to be provided after 15 calendar days of service if the customer received 10 days’ notice that a
deposit was required. For all other customer classes, the POLR provider may require a deposit to
be provided in 10 calendar days. The POLR provider may waive the deposit requirement at the
customer’s request if deposits are waived in a non-discriminatory fashion. If the POLR provider
obtains sufficient data, it must determine whether a residential customer has satisfactory credit based
on the criteria the POLR provider routinely applies to its other residential customers. If the customer
has satisfactory credit, the POLR provider must not request a deposit from the residential customer.
(A) At the time of a mass transition, the executive director or staff designated by the executive
director will distribute available proceeds from an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit in
accordance with the priorities established in §25.107(f)(6) of this title. For a REP that has
obtained a current list from the Low Income List Administrator (LILA) that identifies lowincome customers, these funds must first be used to provide deposit payment assistance for
that REP’s transitioned low-income customers. The Executive Director or staff designee
will, at the time of a transition event, determine the reasonable deposit amount up to $400 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
per customer ESI ID, unless good cause exists to increase the level of the reasonable deposit
amount above $400. Such reasonable deposit amount may take into account factors such
as typical residential usage and current retail residential prices, and, if fully funded, must
satisfy in full the customers’ initial deposit obligation to the VREP or LSP.
(B) For a REP that has obtained a current list from the LILA that identifies low-income
customers, the Executive Director or the staff designee will distribute available proceeds
pursuant to §25.107(f)(6) of this title to the VREPs proportionate to the number of
customers they received in the mass transition, who at the time of the mass transition were
identified as low-income customers by the current LILA list, up to the reasonable deposit
amount set by the Executive Director or staff designee. If funds remain available after
distribution to the VREPs, the remaining funds must be distributed to the appropriate LSPs
by dividing the amount remaining by the number of low income customers as identified in
the LILA list that are allocated to LSPs, up to the reasonable deposit amount set by the
Executive Director or staff designee.
(C) If the funds distributed in accordance with §25.107(f)(6) of this title do not equal the
reasonable deposit amount determined, the VREP and LSP may request from the customer
payment of the difference between the reasonable deposit amount and the amount
distributed. Such difference must be collected in accordance with §25.478(e)(3) of this
title (relating to Credit Requirements and Deposits).
(D) Notwithstanding §25.478(d) of this title, 90 days after the transition date, the VREP or LSP
may request payment of an amount that results in the total deposit held being equal to what
the VREP or LSP would otherwise have charged a customer in the same customer class
and service area in accordance with §25.478(e) of this title, at the time of the transition.
(10) On the occurrence of one or more of the following events, ERCOT must initiate a mass transition
to POLR providers, of all of the customers served by a REP:
(A) Termination of the Load Serving Entity (LSE) or Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE)
Agreement for a REP with ERCOT;
(B) Issuance of a commission order recognizing that a REP is in default under the TDU Tariff
for Retail Delivery Service;
(C) Issuance of a commission order de-certifying a REP;
(D) Issuance of a commission order requiring a mass transition to POLR providers;
(E) Issuance of a judicial order requiring a mass transition to POLR providers; and
(F) At the request of a REP, for the mass transition of all of that REP’s customers.
(11) A REP must not use the mass transition process in this section as a means to cease providing service
to some customers, while retaining other customers. A REP’s improper use of the mass transition
process may lead to de-certification of the REP.
(12) ERCOT may provide procedures for the mass transition process, consistent with this section.
(13) A mass transition under this section must not override or supersede a switch request made by a
customer to switch an ESI ID to a new REP of choice, if the request was made before a mass
transition is initiated. If a switch request has been made but is scheduled for any date after the next
available switch date, the switch must be made on the next available switch date.
(14) ERCOT must identify customers who are mass transitioned for a period of 60 calendar days. The
identification must terminate at the first completed switch or at the end of the 60-day period,
whichever is first. If necessary, ERCOT system changes or new transactions must be implemented
no later than 14 months from the effective date of this section to communicate that a customer was
acquired in a mass transition and is not charged the out-of-cycle meter read pursuant to paragraph
(16) of this subsection.
(15) In the event of a transition to a POLR provider or away from a POLR provider to a REP of choice,
the switch notification notice detailed in §25.474(l) of this title (relating to Selection of Retail
Electric Provider) is not required.
(16) In a mass transition event, the ERCOT initiated transactions must request an out-of-cycle meter read
for the associated ESI IDs for a date two calendar days after the calendar date ERCOT initiates such 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
transactions to the TDU. If an ESI ID does not have the capability to be read in a fashion other than
a physical meter read, the out-of-cycle meter read may be estimated. An estimated meter read for
the purpose of a mass transition to a POLR provider must not be considered a break in a series of
consecutive months of estimates, but must not be considered a month in a series of consecutive
estimates performed by the TDU. A TDU must create a regulatory asset for the TDU fees associated
with a mass transition of customers to a POLR provider pursuant to this subsection. Upon review
of reasonableness and necessity, a reasonable level of amortization of such regulatory asset must be
included as a recoverable cost in the TDU’s rates in its next rate case or such other rate recovery
proceeding as deemed necessary. The TDU must not bill as a discretionary charge, the costs
included in this regulatory asset, which must consist of the following:
(A) fees for out-of-cycle meter reads associated with the mass transition of customers to a
POLR provider; and
(B) fees for the first out-of-cycle meter read provided to a customer who transfers away from
a POLR provider, when the out-of-cycle meter read is performed within 60 calendar days
of the date of the mass transition and the customer is identified as a transitioned customer.
(17) In the event the TDU estimates a meter read for the purpose of a mass transition, the TDU must
perform a true-up evaluation of each ESI ID after an actual meter reading is obtained. Within 10
days after the actual meter reading is obtained, the TDU must calculate the actual average kWh
usage per day for the time period from the most previous actual meter reading occurring prior to the
estimate for the purpose of a mass transition to the most current actual meter reading occurring after
the estimate for the purpose of mass transition. If the average daily estimated usage sent to the
exiting REP is more than 50% greater than or less than the average actual kWh usage per day, the
TDU must promptly cancel and re-bill both the exiting REP and the POLR using the average
actually daily usage.
(q) Termination of POLR service provider status.
(1) The commission may revoke a REP’s POLR status after notice and opportunity for hearing:
(A) If the POLR provider fails to maintain REP certification;
(B) If the POLR provider fails to provide service in a manner consistent with this section;
(C) The POLR provider fails to maintain appropriate financial qualifications; or
(D) For other good cause.
(2) If an LSP defaults or has its status revoked before the end of its term, after a review of the eligibility
criteria, the commission staff designee will, as soon as practicable, designate the next eligible REP,
if any, as an LSP, based on the criteria in subsection (j) of this section.
(3) At the end of the POLR service term, the outgoing LSP must continue to serve customers who have
not selected another REP.
(r) Electric cooperative delegation of authority. An electric cooperative that has adopted customer choice
may select to delegate to the commission its authority to select POLR providers under PURA §41.053(c) in
its certificated service area in accordance with this section. After notice and opportunity for comment, the
commission will, at its option, accept or reject such delegation of authority. If the commission accepts the
delegation of authority, the following conditions apply:
(1) The board of directors must provide the commission with a copy of a board resolution authorizing
such delegation of authority;
(2) The delegation of authority must be made at least 30 calendar days prior to the time the commission
issues a publication of notice of eligibility;
(3) The delegation of authority must be for a minimum period corresponding to the period for which
the solicitation must be made;
(4) The electric cooperative wishing to delegate its authority to designate a continuous provider must
also provide the commission with the authority to apply the selection criteria and procedures
described in this section in selecting the POLR providers within the electric cooperative’s
certificated service area; and
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION.
Effective 11/23/2022
(P 53820)
(5) If there are no competitive REPs offering service in the electric cooperative certificated area, the
commission must automatically reject the delegation of authority.
(s) Reporting requirements. Each LSP that serves customers under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of
this section must file the following information with the commission on a quarterly basis beginning January
of each year in a project established by the commission for the receipt of such information. Each quarterly
report must be filed within 30 calendar days of the end of the quarter.
(1) For each month of the reporting quarter, each LSP must report the total number of new customers
acquired by the LSP under this section and the following information regarding these customers:
(A) The number of customers from whom a deposit was requested pursuant to the provisions
of §25.478 of this title, and the average amount of deposit requested;
(B) The number of customers from whom a deposit was received, including those who entered
into deferred payment plans for the deposit, and the average amount of the deposit;
(C) The number of customers whose service was physically disconnected pursuant to the
provisions of §25.483 of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service) for failure to pay
a required deposit; and
(D) Any explanatory data or narrative necessary to account for customers that were not
included in either subparagraph (B) or (C) of this paragraph.
(2) For each month of the reporting quarter each LSP must report the total number of customers to
whom a disconnection notice was issued pursuant to the provisions of §25.483 of this title and the
following information regarding those customers:
(A) The number of customers who entered into a deferred payment plan, as defined by
§25.480(j) of this title (relating to Bill Payment and Adjustments) with the LSP;
(B) The number of customers whose service was physically disconnected pursuant to §25.483
of this title;
(C) The average amount owed to the LSP by each disconnected customer at the time of
disconnection; and
(D) Any explanatory data or narrative necessary to account for customers that are not included
in either subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph.
(3) For the entirety of the reporting quarter, each LSP must report, for each customer that received
POLR service, the TDU and customer class associated with the customer’s ESI ID, the number of

§25.45. Low-Income List Administrator.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to define the responsibilities of the Low-Income List Administrator
(LILA) to establish and maintain a list of eligible low-income customers and to specify the process for a
retail electric provider (REP) who voluntarily seeks to obtain the low-income customer identification
service from the LILA pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §17.007.
(b) Application. This section applies to the LILA, which has been contracted by the commission to
administer aspects of the low-income customer identification process established under PURA
§17.007 in cooperation with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). This section also
applies to REPs that provide retail electric service in an area that has been opened to customer choice
and that voluntarily seek to obtain the low-income customer identification service from the LILA.
(c) Customer identification process. The LILA must identify eligible low-income customers through a
monthly automatic identification process in cooperation with the HHSC.
(1) Automatic identification is an electronic process to identify customers eligible for the low-income
list by matching client data from the HHSC with residential customer-specific data from
participating REPs.
(A) The HHSC must provide client information to the LILA in accordance with subsection
(d)(1) of this section.
(B) REPs must provide customer information to the LILA in accordance with subsection
(d)(3) of this section.
(C) The LILA shall compare the customer information from the HHSC and REPs, create files
of matching customers and notify the REPs of their eligible customers.
(2) Automatically identified customers shall continue to be included on the LILA’s list of eligible
low-income customers as long as the customers receive qualifying HHSC benefits. Once a
customer no longer receives qualifying HHSC benefits, the customer will no longer be identified
by the LILA’s process as an eligible low-income customer that is sent to the customer’s REP.
(d) Responsibilities. In addition to the requirements established in this section, program responsibilities for the
LILA may be established in the commission’s contract with the LILA; program responsibilities for tasks
undertaken by the HHSC may be established in the memorandum of understanding between the
commission and the HHSC.
(1) HHSC’s responsibilities. The HHSC must assist in the implementation and maintenance of the
automatic enrollment process by providing a database of customers receiving qualifying HHSC
benefits as detailed in the memorandum of understanding between the HHSC and the commission.
(2) The LILA’s responsibilities. The LILA must:
(A) receive customer lists from participating REPs on at least a monthly basis through data
transfer;
(B) retrieve the database of clients from the HHSC on at least a monthly basis;
(C) establish a list of eligible customers, by comparing customer lists from the REPs with
HHSC databases and identifying customer records that reasonably match;
(D) make available to each participating REP, on a date prescribed by the commission on at
least a monthly basis, a list of eligible low-income customers; and
(E) protect the confidentiality of the customer information provided by the REPs and the
client information provided by the HHSC.
(3) A participating REP’s responsibilities. A REP that voluntarily seeks to obtain a list of eligible
low-income customers must:
(A) provide residential customer information to the LILA through data transfer on a date
prescribed by the commission on at least a monthly basis. The customer information shall
include, to the greatest extent possible, each full name of the primary and secondary
customer on each account, billing and service addresses, primary and secondary social

(ESI ID), service provider account number, and premise code;
(B) retrieve from the LILA the list of eligible low-income customers; and
(C) assist the LILA in working to resolve issues concerning customer eligibility.
(e) Confidentiality of information.
(1) The data acquired from HHSC pursuant to this section is subject to a HHSC confidentiality
agreement.
(2) All data transfers from REPs to the LILA pursuant to this section shall be conducted under the
terms and conditions of a standard confidentiality agreement to protect customer privacy and
REPs’ competitively sensitive information.
(3) The LILA may use information obtained pursuant to this section only for purposes prescribed by
commission rule.
(f) Delegation of authority. The commission may delegate to the executive director the authority to contract
with a third-party vendor to administer aspects of the low-income customer identification process
established under PURA §17.007 in cooperation with HHSC, and to negotiate the LILA’s annual fee for
the provision of the low-income customer identification service.
(g) REP annual election process. REPs may elect to obtain the low-income customer identification service
from the LILA on an annual basis.
(1) Not later than May 1 of each year, commission staff must open a project in which a REP may
request the low-income customer identification service for the upcoming fiscal year beginning
September 1. Commission staff must file notice in the project of the total annual cost of the
service at the time the project is opened or as soon as practicable.
(2) Not later than July 31 of each year, a REP must file its request for the low-income customer
identification service in the project opened for that purpose. The filing must include the REP’s
certificate number. In its filing, the REP must state that it agrees to reimburse the commission for
its allocated share of the total cost of providing the service.
(3) Not later than August 31 of each year, if the commission has received a request from one or more
REPs under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the commission will enter an order listing the name
of each REP that filed a request, and establishing the amount that each REP will pay as
determined under paragraph (4) of this subsection.
(4) The total cost of the low-income customer identification service will be allocated equally among
the REPs that have filed a request under paragraph (2) of this subsection unless otherwise
provided by the commission based on the agreement of REPs requesting the low-income customer
identification service.
(5) Provided that at least one REP requests the low-income customer identification service in a
program year in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, a REP that is newly certificated
after July 31 may obtain the low-income customer identification service at no cost to the REP until
the next program year, when the REP has the opportunity to submit a timely request under
paragraph (2) of this subsection. To obtain the low-income customer identification service, the
newly-certificated REP must file a request in the project opened under paragraph (1) of this
subsection.

Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 6/11/98
§25.51. Power Quality.
(a) Voltage variation.
(1) Standard nominal voltages to be adopted. In addition to the nominal voltages that each electric
utility has already adopted, each nominal voltage adopted by an electric utility after approval of this
rule shall be a voltage indicated by the version of the American National Standards Institute,
Incorporated (ANSI) Standard C84.1, Electrical Power Systems and Equipment-Voltage Ratings
(60Hz), or equivalent ANSI standard as later amended, in effect at the time of adoption of the nominal
voltages. An electric utility may adopt different nominal voltages to serve specific customers if such
action does not compromise prudent transmission and distribution system operation.
(2) Nominal voltage limitations. So far as technologically practicable, each electric utility shall maintain
its standard distribution system nominal voltages within the limits specified in the current version of
ANSI Standard C84.1, or equivalent ANSI standard as later amended. Each electric utility offering
service at transmission voltages to customers who have their own transformation equipment shall
maintain such voltages within a range of plus or minus 10% of its adopted nominal voltages.
Variations in distribution system voltage in excess of the limits specified in ANSI C84.1 and
transmission system voltages in excess of plus or minus 10% caused by action of the elements and
infrequent and unavoidable fluctuations of short duration due to station or system operation shall not
be considered violations of this subsection.
(b) Frequency variation. Each electric utility supplying alternating current shall adopt a standard frequency of
60 Hertz. This frequency shall be maintained within the limits stated in the current version of the North
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) operating manual, or succeeding NERC document that may
subsequently replace the operating manual.
(c) Harmonics. In 60 Hertz electric power systems, a harmonic is a sinusoidal component of the 60 Hertz
fundamental wave having a frequency that is an integral multiple of the fundamental frequency. “Excessive
harmonics,” in this subsection, shall mean levels of current or voltage distortion at the point of common
coupling between the electric utility and the customer outside the levels recommended in the IEEE standard
referenced in paragraph (1) of this subsection. Each electric utility shall assist every customer affected with
problems caused by excessive harmonics and customers affected in exceptional cases as described in
paragraph (5) of this subsection.
(1) Applicable standards. In addressing harmonics problems, the electric utility and the customer shall
implement to the extent reasonably practicable and in conformance with prudent operation the
practices outlined in IEEE Standard 519-1992, IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for
Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems, or any successor IEEE standard, to the extent not
inconsistent with law, including state and federal statutes, orders, and regulations, and applicable
municipal regulations.
(2) Investigation. After notice by a customer that it is experiencing problems caused by harmonics, or if
an electric utility otherwise becomes aware of harmonics conditions adversely affecting a customer,
the electric utility shall determine whether the condition constitutes excessive harmonics. If so, the
electric utility shall investigate and determine the cause of the excessive harmonics.
(3) Excessive harmonics created by customer. If an electric utility determines that a customer has
created excessive harmonics that causes or are reasonably likely to cause another customer to receive
unsafe, unreliable or inadequate electric service, the electric utility shall provide written notice to the
customer creating excessive harmonics. The notice shall state that the utility has determined that the
customer has created an excessive harmonics condition and that the utility has explained the source
and consequences of the harmonics problem. The notice shall give the customer two options to cure
the problem.
(A) The electric utility may cure the problem by working on the customer’s electric facilities at a
mutually agreeable time and assess the repair costs to the customer.
(B) The customer may elect to cure the problem at its option and its cost, but the remedy must occur
within a reasonable time, which will be specified in the notice.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 6/11/98
(4) Failure of the customer to remedy the problem. Failure of the customer to remedy the problem
may require the electric utility to disconnect the customer’s service. The electric utility shall then
remedy the excessive harmonics condition, or the electric utility may determine that the customer has
remedied the condition within the time specified. In the event the customer refuses to allow the electric
utility to remedy the problem and does not stop creating excessive harmonics within the time specified,
the electric utility may disconnect the customer’s service. Before disconnecting pursuant to this
subsection, the electric utility must provide written notice of its intent to disconnect at least five
working days before doing so, unless the customer grants the utility access to its electric facilities or
ceases creating excessive harmonics. The electric utility may disconnect the customer five working
days after providing the notice, unless the customer grants the electric utility access to its electric
facilities or ceases creating excessive harmonics.
(5) Excessive harmonics created by an electric utility or third party. If an electric utility determines
that its operation or facilities, or the operations or facilities of a third party other than a customer,
created excessive harmonics that causes or is reasonably likely to cause a customer to receive unsafe,
unreliable or inadequate electric service, the electric utility shall remedy the excessive harmonics
condition at the earliest practical date.
(6) Excessive total harmonic distortion created by two or more harmonic sources within IEEE 519
limits. If, in its investigation of a harmonics problem, an electric utility determines that two or more
customers’ harmonic loads are individually within IEEE 519 limits but the sum of the loads are in
excess of the IEEE 519 limits, the utility may require each customer to reduce its harmonic levels
beyond the limits specified in IEEE 519.
(7) Cost responsibility.
(A) Customer-created excessive harmonics. Electric utilities that remedy a customer-created
excessive harmonics condition shall assess that customer a fee for the investigation and repair of
the condition. Where a customer has remedied the condition, the electric utility shall assess the
customer a fee for investigating the problem. The electric utility shall charge all applicable fees
if required to disconnect the customer. An electric utility fee for investigation and repair of
customer-created excessive harmonics conditions must be reasonable under the circumstances,
and shall equal the electric utility’s actual costs incurred, including its reasonable administrative
costs.
(B) Electric utility-created and third party-created excessive harmonics. Each electric utility that
created an excessive harmonics condition, or that investigated or remedied an excessive
harmonics condition created by a third party other than a customer, must bear the costs incurred
in investigating and remedying the condition, and shall not assess any fees to the affected
customer.
(8) Cooperatives. In fulfilling any of the responsibilities described in this subsection, a retail distribution
cooperative that is a member of a generation and transmission (G & T) cooperative may request the G
& T cooperative’s assistance. The retail distribution cooperative bears full responsibility for ensuring
that this subsection’s requirements are fulfilled.
(d) Power quality monitoring. Each electric utility shall provide, maintain, calibrate, and use appropriate power
monitoring instruments to investigate power quality complaints from its customers and to determine the cause
of disturbances and power quality problems on the utility’s system. In addressing power quality monitoring,
each electric utility shall implement to the extent reasonably practicable and in conformance with prudent
operation the practices outlined in IEEE Standard 1159-1995, IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring
Electric Power Quality, or any successor IEEE standard, to the extent not inconsistent with law, including
state and federal statutes, orders, and regulations, and applicable municipal regulations.

(e) Voltmeters and voltage surveys.
(1) Voltmeters. Each electric utility shall provide, maintain, and use portable voltmeters for testing
voltage regulation, and electric utilities serving more than 250 meters shall provide, maintain, and use
one or more portable recording voltmeters. These instruments shall be of a type and capacity suited
to the voltage supplied.
(2) Voltage surveys. Each electric utility shall make a sufficient number of voltage surveys to adequately
measure the character of service furnished its customers and to satisfy the commission of its
compliance with the voltage requirements. Electric utilities having recording voltmeters shall keep at
least one of these voltmeters in continuous service for the same purpose.

Definitions) and all transmission and distribution utilities as defined by §25.5 of this title. When specifically
stated, this section also applies to electric cooperatives and municipally-owned utilities (MOUs). The term
“utility” as used in this section means an electric utility and a transmission and distribution utility.
(b) General.
(1) Every utility must make all reasonable efforts to prevent interruptions of service. When interruptions
occur, the utility must reestablish service within the shortest possible time.
(2) Each utility must make reasonable provisions to manage emergencies resulting from failure of
service, and each utility must issue instructions to its employees covering procedures to be followed
in the event of emergency in order to prevent or mitigate interruption or impairment of service.
(3) In the event of national emergency or local disaster resulting in disruption of normal service, the
utility may, in the public interest, interrupt service to other customers to provide necessary service
to civil defense or other emergency service entities on a temporary basis until normal service to
these agencies can be restored.
(4) Each utility must maintain adequately trained and experienced personnel throughout its service area
so that the utility is able to fully and adequately comply with the service quality and reliability
standards.
(5) With regard to system reliability, a utility must not neglect any local neighborhood or geographic
area, including rural areas, communities of less than 1,000 persons, and low-income areas.
(6) Each utility that provides distribution service to retail customers must maintain an accurate and
publicly available online outage tracker or outage map on its website.
(A) An online outage tracker or outage map must contain a map of the utility’s distribution
service territory that identifies, for each active outage impacting retail distribution
customers, the approximate location of the outage, the date and time the outage was
reported or otherwise identified, an estimated restoration time, the general status of the
restoration effort, and the date and time the outage and restoration status information was
most recently updated. Information provided by the outage tracker or outage map under
this subparagraph must be updated to include new or updated service addresses in the
utility’s service territory as soon as practicable, and be available in English and Spanish,
as applicable.
(B) If a utility’s outage tracker or outage map is scheduled to be taken offline or may otherwise
become unavailable due to maintenance or upgrades, the utility must post details of the
scheduled activity on its website and provide notice of the scheduled activity to the
commission’s Consumer Protection and Critical Infrastructure Security and Risk
Management divisions no later than seven days prior to the scheduled activity. A utility
must, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the commission in writing if the utility’s
outage tracker or outage map unexpectedly becomes unavailable or if the utility determines
that maintenance is required within the next seven days.
(C) An outage tracker or outage map must provide or link to information that indicates the
different methods a customer may use to report an outage or hazardous condition and
provide or link to information on how a customer may request to receive updates on the
status of outages and outage restoration efforts. The outage tracker or outage map must
include at least one digital means for a customer to report an outage to the utility.
(D) Each utility must comply with each of the requirements of this paragraph upon the effective
date of this rule except as provided in this subparagraph. A that utility requires additional
time to upgrade its outage tracker or outage map to comply with one or more requirements
of this paragraph must file an update in this project no later than five working days after
the effective date of this rule identifying which requirements it is not capable of complying
with, a brief explanation for why immediate compliance is infeasible, and a projected

CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 3/05/25
(P 56897)
any requirement described in a filing under this subparagraph until the earlier of its
projected compliance date and June 1, 2025.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings unless
the context indicates otherwise.
(1) Critical loads — Loads for which electric service is considered crucial for the protection or
maintenance of public safety; including but not limited to hospitals, police stations, fire stations,
critical water and wastewater facilities, and customers with special in-house life-sustaining
equipment.
(2) Critical natural gas facility — A facility designated as a critical customer by the Railroad
Commission of Texas under §3.65(b) of this title (relating to Critical Designation of Natural Gas
Infrastructure) unless the facility has obtained an exception from its critical status. Designation as
a critical natural gas facility does not guarantee the uninterrupted supply of electricity.
(3) Energy emergency — Any event that results in or has the potential to result in firm load shed
required by the reliability coordinator of a power region in Texas.
(4) Interruption classifications:
(A) Forced — Interruptions, exclusive of major events, that result from conditions directly
associated with a component requiring that it be taken out of service immediately, either
automatically or manually, or an interruption caused by improper operation of equipment
or human error.
(B) Scheduled — Interruptions, exclusive of major events, that result when a component is
deliberately taken out of service at a selected time for purposes of construction,
preventative maintenance, or repair. If it is possible to defer an interruption, the interruption
is considered a scheduled interruption.
(C) Outside causes — Interruptions, exclusive of major events, that are caused by influences
arising outside of the distribution system, such as generation, transmission, or substation
outages.
(D) Major events — Interruptions that result from a catastrophic event that exceeds the design
limits of the electric power system, such as an earthquake or an extreme storm. These
events must include situations where there is a loss of power to 10% or more of the
customers in a region over a 24-hour period and with all customers not restored within 24
hours.
(5) Interruption, momentary — Single operation of an interrupting device which results in a voltage
zero and the immediate restoration of voltage.
(6) Interruption, sustained — All interruptions not classified as momentary.
(7) Interruption, significant — An interruption of any classification lasting one hour or more and
affecting the entire system, a major division of the system, a community, a critical load, or service
to interruptible customers; and a scheduled interruption lasting more than four hours that affects
customers that are not notified in advance. A significant interruption includes a loss of service to
20% or more of the system’s customers, or 20,000 customers for utilities serving more than 200,000
customers. A significant interruption also includes interruptions adversely affecting a community
such as interruptions of governmental agencies, military bases, universities and schools, major retail
centers, and major employers.
(8) Reliability indices:
(A) System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) — The average number of
times that a customer’s service is interrupted. SAIFI is calculated by summing the number
of customers interrupted for each event and dividing by the total number of customers on
the system being indexed. A lower SAIFI value represents a higher level of service
reliability.
(B) System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) — The average amount of time
a customer’s service is interrupted during the reporting period. SAIDI is calculated by
summing the restoration time for each interruption event times the number of customers
interrupted for each event and dividing by the total number of customers. SAIDI is 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 3/05/25
(P 56897)
expressed in minutes or hours. A lower SAIDI value represents a higher level of service
reliability.
(d) Record of interruption. Each utility must keep complete records of sustained interruptions of all
classifications. Where possible, each utility must keep a complete record of all momentary interruptions.
These records must show the type of interruption, the cause for the interruption, the date and time of the
interruption, the duration of the interruption, the number of customers interrupted, the substation identifier,
and the transmission line or distribution feeder identifier. In cases of emergency interruptions, the remedy
and steps taken to prevent recurrence must be recorded. Each utility must retain records of interruptions for
five years.
(e) Notice of significant interruptions.
(1) Initial notice. A utility must notify the commission, in a method prescribed by the commission, as
soon as reasonably possible after it has determined that a significant interruption has occurred. The
initial notice must include the general location of the significant interruption, the approximate
number of customers affected, the cause if known, the time of the event, and the estimated time of
full restoration. The initial notice must also include the name and telephone number of the utility
contact person and must indicate whether local authorities and media are aware of the event. If the
duration of the significant interruption is greater than 24 hours, the utility must update this
information daily and file a summary report.
(2) Summary report. Within five working days after the end of a significant interruption lasting more
than 24 hours, the utility must submit a summary report to the commission. The summary report
must include the date and time of the significant interruption; the date and time of full restoration;
the cause of the interruption, the location, substation and feeder identifiers of all affected facilities;
the total number of customers affected; the dates, times, and numbers of customers affected by
partial or step restoration; and the total number of customer-minutes of the significant interruption
(sum of the interruption durations times the number of customers affected).
(f) Priorities for power restoration to certain medical facilities.
(1) A utility must give the same priority that it gives to a hospital in the utility’s emergency operations
plan for restoring power after an extended power outage, as defined by Texas Water Code, §13.1395,
to the following:
(A) An assisted living facility, as defined by Texas Health and Safety Code, §247.002;

(2) Distribution feeder performance. The commission will evaluate the performance of distribution
feeders with ten or more customers after each reporting year. Each utility must maintain and operate
its distribution system so that no distribution feeder with ten or more customers sustains a SAIDI or
SAIFI value for a reporting year that is more than 300% greater than the system average of all
feeders during any two consecutive reporting years.
(3) Enforcement. The commission may take appropriate enforcement action, including action against
a utility, if the system and feeder performance is not operated and maintained in accordance with
this subsection. In determining the appropriate enforcement action, the commission will consider:
(A) the feeder’s operation and maintenance history;
(B) the cause of each interruption in the feeder’s service;
(C) any action taken by a utility to address the feeder’s performance;
(D) the estimated cost and benefit of remediating a feeder’s performance; and
(E) any other relevant factor as determined by the commission.
(h) Critical natural gas facilities. In accordance with §3.65 of this title, critical natural gas standards apply to
each facility in this state designated as a critical customer under §3.65 of this title. In this subsection, the
term “utility” includes MOUs, electric cooperatives, and entities considered utilities under subsection (a) of
this section.
(1) Critical customer information.
(A) In accordance with §3.65 of this title, the operator of a critical natural gas facility must
provide critical customer information to the entities listed in clauses (i) and (ii) of this
subparagraph. The critical customer information must be provided by email using Form
CI-D and any attachments, as prescribed by the Railroad Commission of Texas.
(i) The utility from which the critical natural gas facility receives electric delivery
service; and
(ii) For critical natural gas facilities located in the ERCOT region, the independent
organization certified under PURA §39.151.
(B) The commission will maintain on its website a list of utility email addresses to be used for
the provision of critical customer information under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
Each utility must ensure that the email address listed on the commission’s website is
accurate. If the utility’s email address changes or is inaccurate, the utility must provide the
commission with an updated email address within five business days of the change or of
becoming aware of the inaccuracy.
(C) Within ten business days of receipt, the utility must evaluate the critical customer
information for completeness and provide written notice to the operator of the critical
natural gas facility regarding the status of its critical natural gas designation.
(i) If the information submitted is incomplete, the utility’s notice must specify what
additional information is required and provide a deadline for response that is no
sooner than five business days from when the critical natural gas facility receives
the written notice. If the utility does not receive the additional information in a
timely fashion, the utility may use its discretion to determine if it is possible to
treat the natural gas facility as critical for load shed and power restoration
purposes.
(ii) If the information submitted is complete, the utility’s notice must notify the
operator of the facility’s critical natural gas status, the date of its designation, any
additional classifications assigned to the facility by the utility, and notice that its
critical status does not constitute a guarantee of an uninterrupted supply of energy.
(iii) A utility must provide an additional notice to the operator of the critical natural
gas facility regarding any changes to the information provided in the notice
required under clause (i) of this subparagraph. Notice must be provided within
ten business days of the effective date of the change.

information regarding a critical natural gas facility under this subsection must not release 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 3/05/25
(P 56897)
critical customer information to any person unless authorized by the commission or the
operator of the critical natural gas facility. This prohibition does not apply to the release
of such information to the commission, the Railroad Commission of Texas, the utility from
which the critical natural gas facility receives electric delivery service, the designated
transmission operator, or the independent system operator or reliability coordinator for the
power region in which the critical natural gas facility is located. This prohibition also does
not apply if the critical customer information is redacted, aggregated, or organized in such
a way as to make it impossible to identify the critical natural gas facility to which the
information applies.
(2) Prioritization of critical natural gas facilities. A critical natural gas facility is a critical load
during an energy emergency. A utility must incorporate critical natural gas facilities into its loadshed and restoration planning. For purposes of this paragraph, a utility may also treat a natural gas
facility that self-designated as critical using the Application for Critical Load Serving Electric
Generation and Cogeneration form as a critical natural gas facility, as circumstances require.
(A) A utility must prioritize critical natural gas facilities for continued power delivery during
an energy emergency.
(B) A utility may use its discretion to prioritize power delivery and power restoration among
critical natural gas facilities and other critical loads on its system, as circumstances require.
(C) A utility must consider any additional guidance or prioritization criteria provided by the
commission, the Railroad Commission of Texas, or the reliability coordinator for its power
region to prioritize among critical natural gas facilities and other critical loads during an
energy emergency.

(a) Applicability. This section establishes the requirements for a transmission and distribution utility (TDU) to
lease, operate, and recover costs associated with a temporary emergency electric energy facility (TEEEF).
This section applies to a TDU that operates facilities in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)
region to serve distribution customers.
(b) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings unless the context
indicates otherwise.
(1) Affected generator or load resource -- a generator or load resource that:
(A) is registered with ERCOT for purposes of settlement; and
(B) is located within the portion of the grid that is isolated from the bulk power system and
where a TEEEF is energized to restore power.
(2) Significant power outage -- an event that:
(A) causes ERCOT to order a TDU to shed load;
(B) the Texas Division of Emergency Management, ERCOT, or the executive director of the
commission determines is a significant power outage; or
(C) results in a loss of electric power that:
(i) affects a significant number of a TDU’s distribution customers, and has lasted, or
is expected to last, for at least six hours;
(ii) affects distribution customers of a TDU in an area for which the governor has
issued a disaster or emergency declaration;
(iii) affects distribution customers served by a radial transmission or distribution
facility, creates a risk to public health or safety, and has lasted, or is expected to
last for, at least 12 hours; or
(iv) creates a risk to public health or safety because it affects a critical infrastructure
facility that serves the public such as a hospital, health care facility, law
enforcement facility, fire station, or water or wastewater facility.
(3) Temporary Emergency Electric Energy Facility (TEEEF) -- a facility that provides electric
energy to distribution customers on a temporary basis.
(c) Authorization to lease TEEEF. Except as authorized under subsection (d) of this section, a TDU must not
enter into, renew, or extend any lease involving a TEEEF without receiving prior commission authorization.
Authorization under this subsection applies to a TDU’s TEEEF fleet. A TDU may enter into one or more
leases for TEEEF, simultaneously or consecutively, provided that the capacity and characteristics of its leased
TEEEF fleet complies with the authorization provided under this subsection at all times.
(1) Contents of application. An application under this subsection must include the following:
(A) The TDU’s history with TEEEF, including:
(i) Whether the TDU is currently or has previously been authorized by the
commission to lease TEEEF, the details of existing or prior authorizations, and
each docket number in which the authorization was granted;
(ii) A description of all TEEEF the TDU has under lease at the time of the application,
including the total capacity the TDU has under lease, the length of the lease or
leases, a description of the capacity, intended functions, and relevant
characteristics of each leased unit, and whether each leased unit has been
energized to aid in restoring power during a significant power outage;
(iii) A description of any previous emergency leases of TEEEF or prior use of another
TDU’s TEEEF under a mutual assistance agreement or program. A TDU must
include an explanation for the necessity of each use of TEEEF under an
emergency lease or mutual assistance agreement or program;

was filed, including a cover page with summary statistics on significant power
outages and TEEEF energizations in the TDU’s service territory; and
(v) The interchange item number of the TDU’s most recently filed emergency
operations plan filed in project no. 53385.
(B) The total capacity of TEEEF the TDU is requesting authorization to lease, each function
the requested TEEEF will serve (e.g. to restore power to individual facilities, to restore
power to feeders to assist in load rotation, etc.) and how much of the requested capacity is
requested for each function, and the length of time for which the TDU is requesting
authorization. In support of its request, the TDU must include the following:
(i) A description of any necessary characteristics a TEEEF unit must have to perform
each of the functions for which authorization is requested. These characteristics
should be identified with enough specificity to allow the commission to evaluate,
in a subsequent proceeding, whether the TDU’s leased TEEEF fleet complies with
the commission’s authorization. These characteristics should include, as
applicable, the capacity or range of capacities of individual units, the mobility of
individual units, the types of connections the units must be compatible with, such
as mid-span or point-of-use, fuel type, and whether the units can fulfill the
function individually or with multiple units working in tandem;
(ii) An explanation with any necessary supporting documentation that the functions
the TEEEF is being requested to perform are reasonable and necessary to aid in
the restoration of power under this section. This supporting documentation must
include, at minimum, historical data on significant power outages that occurred in
the TDU’s service territory and would have qualified for TEEEF deployment for
the five-year period preceding the date of the application, including:
(-a-) the start and end date of the outage and information on how long
customers were affected by the outage;
(-b-) a description of the events that caused the outage;
(-c-) the number of affected distribution customers and amount of load, in
megawatts, that were affected by the outage; and
(-d-) the number and type of critical load, critical care customers, or other
critical infrastructure facilities as defined in §25.497 of this title (relating
to Critical Load Industrial Customers, Critical Load Public Safety

(P 53404)
which the application does not comply. The presiding officer must provide the
TDU an opportunity to amend its application. Commission staff must file a
recommendation on sufficiency within 10 working days after the filing of an
amended application, when the amendment is filed in response to a notice of
deficiency.
(iii) If the presiding officer has not filed a written order concluding that the application
is deficient within 10 working days after a deadline for a recommendation on
sufficiency, the application is deemed sufficient.
(B) Notice and intervention. Within one working day after the TDU files its application, the
TDU must provide notice of its filed application, including the docket number assigned to
the application and the deadline for intervention in accordance with this paragraph. The
intervention deadline is 30 days from the date service of notice is complete. The notice
must be provided using a reasonable method of notice to:
(i) all municipalities in the TDU’s service area that have retained original
jurisdiction;
(ii) all parties in the TDU’s last base-rate proceeding;
(iii) each retail electric provider that provides service in the TDU’s service area; and
(iv) the Office of Public Utility Counsel.
(3) Commission evaluation and final determination. The commission will authorize a TDU to lease
TEEEF under this subsection if it determines that leasing the requested TEEEF is reasonable and
necessary to aid in restoring power to the TDU’s distribution customers during a significant power
outage that qualifies for TEEEF energization. The commission’s final order will include the total
TEEEF capacity the TDU is authorized to lease, the capacity of TEEEF the TDU is authorized to
lease for each function the TEEEF fleet will perform, and the date or dates the authorization expires
(i.e., TEEEF leases must not extend past this date). The commission may include additional
requirements related to the characteristics the TEEEF the TDU is authorized to lease.
(d) Emergency TEEEF lease.
(1) A TDU may enter into a lease for TEEEF without prior commission approval if the TDU lacks the
leased TEEEF generating capacity necessary to aid in restoring power, consistent with subsection
(f) of this section.
(2) The amount of TEEEF generating capacity leased by a TDU under this subsection must not exceed
the amount of megawatts or length of time necessary to restore electric service to the TDU’s
distribution customers by more than a reasonable amount.
(3) The TDU must provide sufficient documentation to support the reasonableness, necessity, and
prudence of any generating capacity and costs of TEEEF leased by a TDU under this subsection
during the TDU’s next base-rate proceeding.
(e) Competitive bidding process. Except for an emergency lease under subsection (d) of this section, a TDU
must use a competitive bidding process to lease TEEEF under this section.
(1) In any proceeding in which the commission is reviewing the reasonableness, necessity, or prudence
of the costs associated with leasing a TEEEF under this section, the commission may also consider
whether the contracts the TDU entered into to lease TEEEF were reasonable relative to other bids
that were available to the TDU, if any.
(2) In any proceeding in which a TDU is requesting recovery of costs associated with TEEEF that was
not leased using a competitive bidding process, the TDU must demonstrate that the TEEEF was
leased under an emergency lease consistent with subsection (d).
(3) A TDU may not enter into a lease for TEEEF with a competitive affiliate of the TDU unless that
lease was subject to a competitive bidding process.
(4) If requested by a commissioner or commission staff, a TDU must allow for the inspection of any
lease entered into under this section. If the commissioner or commission staff retains a copy of the
lease, the lease will be treated as a confidential document if so requested by the TDU.

Effective 1/08/25
(P 53404)
(f) Energization of TEEEF.
(1) A TDU may energize TEEEF to aid in restoring power to its distribution customers during an event
that a TDU reasonably determines is a significant power outage in which:
(A) ERCOT has ordered the TDU to shed load; or
(B) the TDU’s distribution facilities are not being fully served by the bulk power system under
normal operations.
(2) A TDU may loan its leased TEEEF to other TDUs or otherwise utilize its leased TEEEF in another
TDU’s service territory under a mutual assistance agreement or program, provided that all costs and
reimbursements associated with such a loan or utilization are properly accounted for and reconciled.
(3) A TDU that leases a TEEEF must not sell energy or ancillary services from the facility.
(4) A TEEEF must:
(A) be operated in isolation from the bulk power system; and
(B) not be included in locational marginal price calculations, pricing, or reliability models
developed by ERCOT.
(5) Notice. A TDU must issue notices under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this paragraph to
ERCOT and all operators of affected generators or load resources. Notice under this paragraph is
not required if the area isolated from the bulk power system does not contain any affected generators
or load resources.
(A) Prior to isolation. For an isolation from the bulk power system due to circumstances
within a TDU’s control in which TEEEF will be energized, a TDU must issue notice at
least 10 minutes prior to isolation of an affected area from the bulk power system. For an
isolation from the bulk power system due to circumstances beyond a TDU’s control in
which TEEEF will be energized, a TDU must issue notice as soon as is reasonably
practicable. Notices prior to isolation of an affected area from the bulk power system must
include:
(i) identification of each substation and modeled load associated with customer load
that will be served by TEEEF;
(ii) the total amount of load expected to be served by TEEEF;
(iii) the time the affected area is anticipated to be isolated from the bulk power system;
(iv) the time the affected area is anticipated to be reconnected to the bulk power
system;
(v) identification of each generator or load resource that will be an affected generator
or load resource following the energization of TEEEF; and
(vi) a statement that any energy produced by an affected generator during the time it
is isolated from the bulk power system will not be settled through ERCOT.
(B) Upon isolation. For an isolation from the bulk power grid due to circumstances within a
TDU’s control in which TEEEF will be energized, a TDU must issue notice immediately
upon isolation of an affected area from the bulk power system. For an isolation from the
bulk power system due to circumstances beyond a TDU’s control in which TEEEF will be
energized, a TDU must issue notice as soon as is reasonably practicable. A notice issued
under this subparagraph must state the time an affected area’s isolation from the bulk power
system was completed.
(C) Prior to reconnection. A TDU must issue notice at least 10 minutes prior to the
reconnection of an affected area to the bulk power system. A notice issued under this
subparagraph must state the anticipated time that an affected area will be reconnected to
the bulk power system.
(D) Upon reconnection. A TDU must issue notice immediately after the reconnection of an
affected area to the bulk power system has been completed. A notice issued under this
subparagraph must state the time the reconnection of an affected area to the bulk power
system was completed.
(E) If a TDU has issued notice under subparagraphs (A) or (C) of this paragraph, and
coordination with ERCOT under paragraph (6) of this subsection results in a delay in the 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 1/08/25
(P 53404)
anticipated time of isolation or reconnection, the TDU must notify operators of affected
generators and load resources of such delay.
(6) Coordination with ERCOT.
(A) TDUs. The requirements of this subparagraph apply only to energizations of TEEEF that
occur outside of an energy emergency declared by ERCOT. A TDU’s isolation or
reconnection of load associated with an energization of TEEEF must be coordinated with
ERCOT according to the following timeframes if the total amount of load at any single
substation that would be isolated or reconnected exceeds 20 megawatts.
(i) For isolations of load from the bulk power system due to circumstances within a
TDU’s control, a TDU should coordinate with ERCOT within a period of 10
minutes.
(ii) For isolations of load from the bulk power system due to circumstances beyond a
TDU’s control, a TDU should coordinate with ERCOT as soon as is reasonably
practicable.
(B) Affected generators and load resources.
(i) Upon receiving notice from a TDU that an affected area will be isolated from the
bulk power system, an operator of an affected generator or load resource that is
required by ERCOT protocols to provide status telemetry to ERCOT must, at the
expected time of isolation as indicated in the TDU’s notice, update its real-time
status telemetry and current operating plan information to reflect that the affected
generator or load resource is disconnected from the ERCOT system, is
unavailable for dispatch by ERCOT, and will be unavailable for dispatch by
ERCOT for the time period specified by the TDU in its notice.
(ii) Upon receiving notice from a TDU that an affected area has been reconnected to
the bulk power system, the operator of any affected generator or load resource
must update its real-time status telemetry and current operating plan information
to reflect the appropriate status of the affected generator or load resource.
(7) A TDU’s liability related to the provision of service using a TEEEF is governed by §25.214 of this
title (relating to Terms and Conditions of Retail Delivery Service Provided by Investor-Owned
Transmission and Distribution Utilities).
(8) A TDU will ensure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that:
(A) A retail distribution customer’s usage during the TDU’s operation of a TEEEF is excluded
or removed from the electric usage reported to ERCOT for final settlement and to retail
electric providers (REPs) for customer billing; and
(B) Energy generated in an area isolated from the bulk power system in accordance with this
section, including any energy generated by an affected generator, is excluded or removed
from the generation reported to ERCOT for final settlement purposes.
(9) During an energy emergency declared by ERCOT, the amount of any load shed by a TDU for the
area operated in isolation from the bulk power system during TEEEF energization must be
accounted for net of any generation in the affected area that was online and producing before the
area was isolated from the bulk power system.
(10) After-action report. After each significant power outage in a TDU’s service territory that meets
the criteria for TEEEF energization under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a TDU that has leased
TEEEF must file an after-action report with the commission. The report must be filed within 30
days from the last day of the significant power outage. The report must include, as applicable:
(A) A description of the events that resulted in the significant power outage within the TDU’s
service territory, including the dates and times the significant power outage began and
ended;
(B) The estimated number of affected distribution customers and estimated amount of load, in
megawatts, that were affected by the significant power outage in the TDU’s service
territory and the estimated number of which that were served by TEEEF;
(C) The estimated number and type of critical load, critical care customers or other critical
infrastructure facilities as defined in §25.497 of this title, affected by the significant power 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 1/08/25
(P 53404)
outage and the estimated number that were served by TEEEF. A TDU must also include
available details on the duration of service interruptions for these customers;
(D) The total nameplate generating capacity in megawatts and the total number of affected
generators or load resources that were isolated from the bulk power system for TEEEF
energization.
(E) A description of any TEEEF energizations, including the capacity, fuel type, connection
configuration, and mobile capability of each TEEEF unit that was energized, the function
each TEEEF unit was performing, the date and time each TEEEF unit was energized, and
the duration that the affected area was isolated from the bulk power system;
(F) A list of TEEEF that was not energized, including the capacity, fuel type, connection
configuration, and mobile capability of each TEEEF unit that was not energized and a
brief summary explaining why each TEEEF unit was not energized.
(G) A description of any TEEEF units that were leased under subsection (d) of this section or
utilized under a mutual assistance agreement or program. A TDU must include an
explanation for the necessity of the emergency lease or utilization of the mutual assistance
agreement or program;
(g) Emergency operations annex. A TDU that leases TEEEF under this section must include a detailed plan
on the use of the TDU’s leased TEEEF in the TDU’s emergency operations plan filed with the commission,
as required by §25.53 of this title (relating to Electric Service Emergency Operations Plans), that is updated,
as necessary, on an ongoing basis.
(h) Eligible costs.
(1) Costs to obtain, and operate a TEEEF. Reasonable and necessary costs of leasing, and operating
a TEEEF, including the present value of future payments required under the lease, are eligible for
recovery under this section. A lease involving a TEEEF must be treated as a capital lease or finance
lease for ratemaking purposes, regardless of its classification under generally accepted accounting
principles or other accounting frameworks.
(2) Return. Reasonable and necessary costs under this section include a return on investment,
including the present value of future payments required under the lease, using the rate of return on
investment established in the commission’s final order in a TDU’s most recent comprehensive baserate proceeding.
(i) Deferred recovery of certain eligible costs. A TDU may create a regulatory asset to defer the following
for recovery in a future ratemaking proceeding:
(1) The reasonable and necessary incremental operations and maintenance expenses, not otherwise
included in any of the TDU’s rates; and
(2) The return, not otherwise included in any of the TDU’s rates.
(j) Cost recovery. Eligible costs under this section may be recovered as follows.
(1) Ratemaking proceedings. A TDU may request recovery of eligible costs, including any deferred
expenses, through a standalone TEEEF rider proceeding, a proceeding under §25.243 of this title
(relating to Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF)), or in another ratemaking proceeding where
it is appropriate to recover distribution invested capital and associated costs. A river authority may
request recovery of eligible costs, including any deferred expenses, through a ratemaking
proceeding where it is appropriate to recover distribution invested capital and associated costs or
through a standalone TEEEF rider proceeding.
(A) A TDU must provide notice to REPs of the approved rates not later than the 45th day prior
to the effective date of the approved.
(B) TEEEF costs must not be allocated to, or collected from, retail transmission service
customers or wholesale transmission service at transmission voltage customers.
(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of §25.243 of this title, an allocation of TEEEF costs
among distribution-level rate classes, based on substation-level class non-coincident peak 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 1/08/25
(P 53404)
demand, regardless of the time at which the class demand occurs, from the TDU’s current
or most recent base-rate proceeding, is presumed to be reasonable.
(D) TEEEF rates may not be established on a per-kilowatt-hour basis for any customer class
that includes demand charges.
(E) Upon any amendment to a lease under this section that would reduce the rate of cost
recovery necessary for a TEEEF, a TDU must submit an application to reflect the reduced
rate of cost recovery necessary, by the earlier of three months from the lease amendment
or the TDU’s next DCRF proceeding.
(F) TEEEF costs must not be included in base rates. All TEEEF costs must be recovered
through a single rider associated with TEEEF. A TDU with a previously established
TEEEF rider may recover additional TEEEF costs by updating the existing TEEEF rider.
(G) TEEEF costs will not be reviewed for reasonableness, necessity, or prudence in a
proceeding other than a base-rate proceeding, unless the presiding officer finds good cause
to review them in another proceeding.
(H) In any proceeding in which TEEEF costs are reviewed for reasonableness, necessity, or
prudence, the application must include the after-action reports for significant power
outages during the period for which costs are being reviewed. The application must also
include the leases, filed confidentially, for any leased TEEEF for which costs are being
reviewed.
(I) A TDU that, prior to the effective date of this rule, received commission approval in a
contested case proceeding for an amount of TEEEF generating capacity may request
approval of reductions of that capacity through a subsequent standalone TEEEF rider
proceeding made in accordance with this paragraph.
(2) Notice. The notice for any ratemaking proceeding in which eligible TEEEF costs are sought must
specifically identify those eligible costs.
(3) Affiliate contracts. For any contract between a TDU and an affiliate, the TDU bears the burden of
proof to show that the terms to the TDU were reasonable and necessary and did not exceed the prices
charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions or to unaffiliated persons within
the same market area or having the same market conditions. In addition, all affiliate payments must
comply with the requirements of PURA §36.058.
(4) Reconciliation. If TEEEF rates include any eligible costs that have not been reviewed for
reasonableness, necessity, and prudence, any rates to recover any portion of those costs are
temporary rates that must be reconciled in the TDU’s next base-rate proceeding, including to
determine whether the costs are reasonable, necessary, and prudent.
(A) In reconciling TEEEF costs, all revenues received associated with TEEEF programs,
including actual rate revenues and mutual assistance reimbursements, must be applied to
offset reasonable, necessary, and prudent TEEEF costs as these costs and revenues were
incurred and received.
(B) A TDU must provide comprehensive testimony and workpapers supporting the
reconciliation of all eligible costs and associated rate revenues as part of any base-rate
proceeding application. Any amounts recovered through rates approved under this
subsection that are found to have been unreasonable, unnecessary, or imprudent, plus the
corresponding return, taxes, and carrying costs, must either be refunded or applied as an
offset to any outstanding regulatory asset associated with eligible costs. In any proceeding
in which the commission determines that a TDU has included in rates any amounts deemed
unreasonable, unnecessary, or imprudent, or that the TDU has otherwise over-recovered
costs, the commission may order a compliance proceeding to determine the amounts and
manner of any necessary refunds to ratepayers or the proper accounting of over-recovered
amounts as an offset to any outstanding regulatory assets associated with eligible costs.
Carrying costs will be determined as follows:
(i) For the time period beginning with the date on which over-recovery is determined
to have begun to the effective date of the TDU’s base rates set in the base-rate
proceeding in which the costs are reconciled, carrying costs will accrue monthly 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 1/08/25
(P 53404)
and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate based on the same
rate of return that was applied to the TDU’s rate base included in base rates in
effect when the over-recovery began.
(ii) For the time period beginning with the effective date of the TDU’s rates set in the
base-rate proceeding in which the costs are reconciled, carrying costs will accrue
monthly and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate based on
the TDU’s rate of return authorized in that base-rate proceeding.
(5) As part of the reconciliation of TEEEF costs, the commission may consider whether the leased
TEEEF had the characteristics required to perform the functions authorized by the commission,
whether the TEEEF was properly utilized to restore power during significant power outages,
including appropriate pre-outage preparations such as positioning and securing fuel or the units, or
any other factor relevant to the prudence or reasonableness of the TDU’s procurement or operation
of TEEEF.

§25.57. Power Outage Alert Criteria.
(a) Purpose and Applicability. This section establishes criteria for the activation, content, and termination of
regional and statewide power outage alerts as required by Tex. Gov’t Code §411.301(b). This section applies
to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and to transmission service providers in power regions
in Texas other than the ERCOT region.
(b) Definitions.
(1) Load shed instructions -- Directives given by a reliability coordinator to a transmission service
provider or its agent to reduce firm load along its systems by a prescribed amount.
(2) System-wide -- The entirety of a power region.
(c) Issuance and termination of a power outage alert. The executive director may recommend the Texas
Department of Public Safety issue, update, or terminate a power outage alert. A designee may act on behalf
of the executive director under this section.
(1) The executive director may recommend the Texas Department of Public Safety issue a power outage
alert statewide or for one or more specific power regions in Texas. The issuance of a power outage
alert may be recommended for power regions in which system-wide load shed instructions have
been issued or are likely to be issued because the system-wide power supply is likely to be
inadequate to meet demand.
(2) In determining whether to recommend the issuance of a power outage alert, the executive director
will consider the likelihood of system-wide load shed instructions being issued, the expected length
of time the load shed instructions will be in effect, and any other relevant information. In
determining whether to recommend the issuance of a power outage alert in the ERCOT region, the
executive director will consider information received from ERCOT under subsection (d) of this
section. In determining whether to recommend the issuance of a power outage alert in a power
region other than the ERCOT region, the executive director will consider information received from
transmission service providers in that power region under subsection (e) of this section.
(3) The executive director may recommend the termination of a power outage alert when the conditions
that led to the issuance of the power outage alert are no longer applicable and are unlikely to recur
in the near future.
(d) Power outage alerts for the ERCOT region.
(1) ERCOT must notify the executive director when:
(A) ERCOT’s forecasts indicate system-wide generation supply is likely to be insufficient to
meet demand within the next 48 hours; or
(B) ERCOT issues system-wide load shed instructions.
(2) A notice under paragraph (1) of this subsection must include any available, relevant information to
assist the executive director in determining whether to recommend the issuance of a power outage
alert and what information should be included in the power outage alert. The notice must include,
but is not limited to:
(A) Whether system-wide load shed instructions have been issued;
(B) Whether system-wide power supply is forecasted to be insufficient to meet demand and, if
so, an estimated time when load shed instructions may be issued;
(C) If applicable and known, an estimated time when load shed instructions may be recalled;
and
(D) If applicable and known, the initiating event or circumstances that prompted or might
prompt the issuance of load shed instructions.
(3) ERCOT must notify the executive director when system-wide load shed instructions have been
recalled or when, in ERCOT’s judgment, there are material changes in ERCOT’s forecasts. This
notice must include information on any of the remaining conditions listed under paragraph (1) of
this subsection that are still applicable.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 6/15/22
(P 52287)
(4) ERCOT must establish a procedure, in consultation with commission staff, to provide the executive
director with notifications required under this subsection.
(5) Upon request by the executive director, ERCOT must provide additional information and updates.
(e) Power outage alerts for power regions other than the ERCOT region.
(1) A transmission service provider in a power region other than the ERCOT region must notify the
executive director when it has received system-wide load shed instructions from the applicable
reliability coordinator.
(2) The transmission service provider must notify the executive director when the applicable reliability
coordinator has recalled the system-wide load shed instructions. The transmission service provider’s
notice must include a summary of any available information regarding power outages and the
expectation for power restoration within its service territory.
(3) A transmission service provider subject to this subsection must establish a procedure, in consultation
with commission staff, to provide the executive director with notifications required under this
subsection. Commission staff may develop a form, internet portal, or other standardized process for
providing the executive director with notifications required under this subsection. If commission
staff develops such a standardized process, a transmission service provider’s procedure must utilize
this standardized process.

§25.59. Long Lead-Time Facilities.
(a) Applicability. This section provides that a transmission and distribution utility (TDU) may procure, own,
operate, and recover costs of long lead-time facilities. This section applies to a TDU that operates distribution
facilities in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to serve distribution customers.
(b) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings unless the context
indicates otherwise.
(1) Long lead-time facilities -- transmission and distribution facilities that would aid in restoring power
to the TDU’s distribution customers following a significant power outage and that the TDU
reasonably anticipates will require at least six months to obtain. These facilities may not include
energy storage equipment or facilities as described under Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA),
Chapter 35, Subchapter E.
(2) Significant power outage -- an event that:
(a) causes ERCOT to order a TDU to shed load;
(b) the Texas Division of Emergency Management, ERCOT, or the executive director of the
commission determines should be classified as a significant power outage; or
(c) results in a loss of electric power that:
(i) affects a significant number of a TDU’s distribution customers and has lasted, or
is expected to last, for at least six hours;
(ii) affects a TDU’s distribution customers in an area for which the governor has
issued a disaster or emergency declaration;
(iii) affects a TDU’s distribution customers served by a radial transmission or
distribution facility, creates a risk to public health or safety, and has lasted, or is
expected to last, for at least 12 hours; or
(iv) creates a risk to public health or safety because it affects a critical infrastructure
facility that serves the public such as a hospital, health care facility, law
enforcement facility, fire station, or water or wastewater facility.
(c) Contracts for long lead-time facilities. A TDU may enter into contracts to procure, own, and operate long
lead-time facilities. Such contractual arrangements may include cooperative agreements with another TDU
or procurement subscriptions with a transmission and distribution equipment supply service company or
other third party as described under this section.
(1) Cooperative agreements. A TDU may enter into a cooperative agreement with another TDU to:
(A) jointly procure, own, and operate long lead-time facilities;
(B) maintain inventories of long lead-time transmission and distribution equipment; or
(C) engage in transfers of such facilities or equipment following a significant power outage.
(2) Procurement subscriptions. A TDU may subscribe with a transmission and distribution
equipment supply service to access and utilize an inventory of transmission and distribution
equipment for the construction, modification, or operation of long lead-time facilities.
(d) Emergency operations annex. A TDU that procures, owns, and operates long lead-time facilities under this
section must include these facilities in the TDU’s emergency operations plan filed with the commission, as
required by §25.53 of this title (relating to Electric Service Emergency Operations Plans), on an ongoing
basis.
(e) Eligible costs.
(1) Costs to procure, own, and operate long lead-time facilities. Reasonable and necessary costs of
procuring, owning, and operating long lead-time facilities, including costs incurred under a
cooperative agreement or procurement subscription, are eligible for recovery under this section, to
the extent these costs are not otherwise included in the TDU’s rates.
(2) Return. Reasonable and necessary costs under this section include a return on investment using the
rate of return on investment established in the commission’s final order in the TDU’s most recent 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 1/08/2025
(P 53404)
comprehensive base-rate proceeding. The return may be applied beginning on the date that a long
lead-time facility is procured.
(f) Deferred recovery of certain eligible costs. A TDU may create a regulatory asset to defer to a future
ratemaking proceeding the recovery of incremental operations and maintenance expenses and the return, not
otherwise recovered in a rate proceeding, associated with the procurement, ownership, maintenance, and
operation of long lead-time facilities. These costs may be recorded, in order to be requested for recovery in
a future proceeding, beginning on the date the long lead-time facility is procured.
(g) Cost recovery. Eligible costs under this section may be recovered as follows.
(1) Ratemaking proceedings.
(A) A TDU may:
(i) request recovery of eligible costs, including any deferred expenses, pertaining to
distribution invested capital and its associated costs through a proceeding under
§25.243 of this title (relating to Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF)), or
in another ratemaking proceeding appropriate to recover distribution-invested
capital and its associated costs; and
(ii) A TDU may request recovery of eligible costs under this section, including any
deferred expenses, pertaining to transmission-invested capital and its associated
costs through a proceeding under §25.192(h) of this title (relating to Interim
Update of Transmission Rates) or in another ratemaking proceeding appropriate
to recover transmission-invested capital and its associated costs.
(B) A TDU seeking cost recovery under this section must include sufficient documentation in
its filing to support a determination that the facilities procured meet the definition of long
lead-time facilities under subsection (b)(1) of this section.
(2) Notice. The notice for any ratemaking proceeding in which eligible costs addressed in this section
are sought must specifically identify those eligible costs. Notice under this paragraph is required
for all costs that have not been reconciled on or before the effective date of this rule.
(3) Affiliate contracts. For any contract between the TDU and an affiliate, the TDU bears the burden
of proof that the terms to the TDU were reasonable, necessary, prudent, and did not exceed the
prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions or to unaffiliated persons
within the same market area or having the same market condition. In addition, all affiliate payments
must comply with the requirements of PURA §36.058.
(4) Temporary rates and reconciliation. If any rates include eligible costs that have not been
reviewed for prudence, reasonableness, and necessity, the rates to recover those costs are temporary
rates that must be reconciled in the TDU’s next base-rate proceeding.
(A) A TDU must provide comprehensive testimony and workpapers supporting the
reconciliation of all eligible costs and associated rate revenues as part of any base-rate
proceeding application. Any amounts recovered through rates approved under this
subsection that are found to have been unreasonable, unnecessary, or imprudent, plus the
corresponding return, taxes, and carrying charges, must either be refunded or applied as an
offset to any outstanding regulatory asset associated with eligible costs.
(B) In any proceeding in which the commission determines that a TDU has included in rates
any amounts deemed unreasonable, unnecessary, or imprudent, or that the TDU has
otherwise over-recovered costs, the commission may order a compliance proceeding to
determine the amounts and manner of any necessary refunds to ratepayers or the proper
accounting of over-recovered amounts as an offset to any outstanding regulatory assets
associated with eligible costs. Carrying costs will be determined as follows:
(i) For the time period beginning with the date on which over-recovery is determined
to have begun to the effective date of the TDU’s base rates set in the base-rate
proceeding in which the costs are reconciled, carrying costs will accrue monthly
and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate based on the same 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 1/08/2025
(P 53404)
rate of return that was applied to the TDU’s rate base included in base rates in
effect when the over-recovery began.
(ii) For the time period beginning with the effective date of the TDU’s rates set in the
base-rate proceeding in which the costs are reconciled, carrying costs will accrue
monthly and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate based on
the TDU’s rate of return authorized in that base-rate proceeding.

§25.62. Transmission and Distribution System Resiliency Plans.
(a) Purpose and applicability. This section allows an electric utility that owns and operates a transmission or
distribution system to file a resiliency plan to enhance the resiliency of the electric utility’s transmission and
distribution system. The requirements of this section will be construed, to the extent practicable, to reflect
the following:
(1) Each transmission and distribution system has different system characteristics and faces different
resiliency events and resiliency-related risks. The ability to precisely define, measure, and address
these events and risks varies. Terms such as “event,” “risk,” “criteria,” and “metric” will be
construed pragmatically to provide each utility with the flexibility to develop a well-tailored and
systematic approach to improving the resiliency of its system.
(2) A utility seeking approval of a resiliency plan bears the burden of proof on each aspect of its
resiliency plan. Nothing in this section categorically limits the type of evidence that a utility may
use to meet this burden. The weight given to each piece of evidence will be determined by the
commission on a case-by-case basis based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Provisions
contained in this section addressing the weight of certain types of evidence are advisory only.
(b) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings unless the context
indicates otherwise.
(1) Distribution invested capital -- The parts of the electric utility’s invested capital that are
categorized or properly functionalized as distribution plant and, once they are placed into service,
are properly recorded in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Uniform System of
Accounts 303, 352, 353, 360 through 374, 391, and 397. Distribution invested capital includes only
costs: for plant that has been placed into service or will be placed into service prior to rates going
into effect; that comply with PURA, including §36.053 and §36.058; and that are prudent,
reasonable, and necessary. Distribution invested capital does not include: generation-related costs;
transmission-related costs, including costs recovered through rates set pursuant to §25.192 of this
title (relating to Transmission Service Rates), §25.193 of this title (relating to Distribution Service
Provider Transmission Cost Recovery Factors (TCRF)), or §25.239 of this title (relating to
Transmission Cost Recovery Factor for Certain Electric Utilities); indirect corporate costs;
capitalized operations and maintenance expenses; and distribution invested capital recovered
through a separate rate, including a surcharge, tracker, rider, or other mechanism.
(2) Resiliency cost recovery rider (RCRR) billing determinant -- Each rate class’s annual billing
determinant (kilowatt-hour, kilowatt, or kilovolt-ampere) for the most recent 12 months ending no
earlier than 90 days prior to an application for a Resiliency Cost Recovery Rider, weathernormalized and adjusted to reflect the number of customers at the end of the period.
(3) Resiliency event -- an event involving extreme weather conditions, wildfires, cybersecurity threats,
or physical security threats that poses a material risk to the safe and reliable operation of an electric
utility’s transmission and distribution systems. A resiliency event is not primarily associated with
resource adequacy or an electric utility’s ability to deliver power to load under normal operating
conditions.
(4) Resiliency-related distribution invested capital -- Distribution invested capital associated with a
resiliency plan approved under this section that will be placed into service before or at the time the
associated rates become effective under this section, and that are not otherwise included in a utility’s
rates.
(5) Resiliency-related net distribution invested capital -- Resiliency-related distribution invested
capital that is:
(A) adjusted for accumulated depreciation and any changes in accumulated deferred federal
income taxes, including changes to excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes,
associated with all resiliency-related distribution invested capital included in the electric
utility’s RCRR; 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024
(P 55250)
(B) reduced by the amount of net plant investment associated with any distribution invested
capital included in a utility’s rates that is retired or replaced, at the time the associated rates
become effective under this section, by resiliency-related distribution invested capital; and
(C) further adjusted to remove accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred federal
income taxes associated with distribution invested capital included in a utility’s rates that
is retired or replaced, at the time the associated rates become effective under this section,
by resiliency-related distribution invested capital.
(6) Weather-normalized -- Adjusted for normal weather using weather data for the most recent tenyear period prior to the year from which the RCRR billing determinants are derived.
(c) Resiliency Plan. An electric utility may file a plan to prevent, withstand, mitigate, or more promptly recover
from the risks posed by resiliency events to its transmission and distributions systems. A resiliency plan may
be updated, but the updated plan must not take effect earlier than three years from the date of approval of the
electric utility’s most recently approved resiliency plan.
(1) Resiliency measures. A resiliency plan is comprised of one or more measures designed to prevent,
withstand, mitigate, or more promptly recover from the risks posed to the electric utility’s
transmission and distribution systems by resiliency events, as described in subsection (d) of this
section. Each measure must utilize one or more of the following methods:
(A) hardening electric transmission and distribution facilities;
(B) modernizing electric transmission and distribution facilities;
(C) undergrounding certain electric distribution lines;
(D) lightning mitigation measures;
(E) flood mitigation measures;
(F) information technology;
(G) cybersecurity measures;
(H) physical security measures;
(I) vegetation management; or
(J) wildfire mitigation and response.
(2) Contents of the resiliency plan. The resiliency plan must be organized by measure, including a
description of any activities, actions, standards, services, procedures, practices, structures, or
equipment associated with each measure.
(A) The resiliency plan must identify, for each measure, one or more risks posed by resiliency
events that the measure is intended to prevent, withstand, mitigate, or more promptly
recover from.
(i) The resiliency plan must explain the electric utility’s prioritization of the
identified resiliency event and, if applicable, the prioritization of the particular
geographic area, system, or facilities where the measure will be implemented.
(ii) The resiliency plan must include evidence of the effectiveness of the measure in
preventing, withstanding, mitigating, or more promptly recovering from the risks
posed by the identified resiliency event. The commission will give greater weight
to evidence that is quantitative, performance-based, or provided by an
independent entity with relevant expertise.
(iii) A resiliency plan must explain the expected benefits of the resiliency measures
including, as applicable, reduced system restoration costs, reduction in the
frequency or duration of outages for customers. and any improvement in the
overall service reliability for customers, including the classes of customers served
and any critical load designations.
(iv) The electric utility must identify if a resiliency measure is a coordinated effort
with federal, state, or local government programs or may benefit from any federal,
state, or local government funding opportunities.
(v) The resiliency plan must explain the selection of each measure over any
reasonable and readily-identifiable alternatives. The resiliency plan must contain
sufficient analysis and evidence, such as cost or performance comparisons, to 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024
(P 55250)
support the selection of each measure. In selecting between measures, whether a
measure would support the plan’s systematic approach may be considered.
(vi) The resiliency plan must identify any measures that may require a transmission
system outage to implement. The electric utility must coordinate with its
independent system operator before implementing these measures. Upon request,
the electric utility must provide its independent system operator, using mutuallyagreed to transfer and data security procedures, a complete copy of its resiliency
plan.
(B) Resiliency events.
(i) A resiliency plan must define identify and describe each type of resiliency event
and any associated resiliency-related risks the plan is designed to prevent,
withstand, mitigate, or more promptly recover from. A resiliency event may be
defined using an established definition (e.g., a hurricane) or a plan- or measurespecific definition based on the risks posed by that type of event to the electric
utility’s systems (e.g., flooding of a specified depth). Each type of resiliency
event must be defined with sufficient detail to allow the electric utility or
commission to determine whether an actual set of circumstances qualifies as a
resiliency event of that type.
(ii) If appropriate, one or more magnitude thresholds must be included in the
definition of a resiliency event type based on the risks posed to the electric utility’s
systems by that type of event. A resiliency plan may establish multiple magnitude
thresholds for a single type of resiliency event (e.g., categories of hurricanes)
when necessary to conduct a more granular analysis of the risks posed by the event
and the options available to prevent, withstand, mitigate, or more promptly
recover from them.
(iii) The resiliency plan must include a description of the system characteristics that
make the electric utility’s transmission and distribution systems susceptible to
each identified resiliency event type.
(iv) A resiliency plan must provide sufficient evidence to support the presence of and
risk posed by each identified resiliency event. The resiliency plan must provide
historical evidence of the electric utility’s experience with, if applicable, and
forecasted risk of the identified event type, including whether the forecasted risk
is specific to a particular system or geographic area. In assessing the presence and
risk posed by each resiliency event, the commission will give great weight to any
studies conducted by an independent system operator or independent entity with
relevant expertise.
(C) Evaluation metric or criteria. Each measure in the resiliency plan must include a
proposed metric or criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of that measure in preventing,
withstanding, mitigating, or more promptly recovering from the risks associated with the
resiliency event it is designed to address.
(i) The resiliency plan must explain the appropriateness of the selected evaluation
metric or criteria.
(ii) For an evaluation metric or criteria that is not quantitative, the resiliency plan must
explain why quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of that measure is not
possible.
(iii) The resiliency plan must also include an estimate or analysis of the expected
effectiveness of each measure using the selected evaluation metric or criteria.
(D) If a resiliency plan includes measures that are similar to other existing programs or
measures, such as a storm hardening plan under §25.95 of this title (relating to Electric
Utility Infrastructure Storm Hardening) or a vegetation management plan under §25.96 of
this title (relating to Vegetation Management), or programs or measures otherwise required
by law, the electric utility must distinguish the measures in the resiliency plan from these
programs and measures and, if appropriate, explain how the related items work in 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024
(P 55250)
conjunction with one another.
(E) A resiliency plan must be implemented using a systematic approach over a period of at
least three years. The resiliency plan must explain this systematic approach and provide
implementation details for each of the plan’s measures, including estimated capital costs,
estimated operations and maintenance expenses, an estimated timeline for completion, and,
when practicable and appropriate, estimated net salvage value (value of the retired asset
less depreciation and cost of removal) and remaining service lives of any assets expected
to be retired or replaced by resiliency-related investments. The resiliency plan should
identify relevant cost drivers (e.g., line miles, frequency of inspections, frequency of trim
cycles, etc.) that would affect the estimates.
(F) A utility may deviate from the implementation schedule specified in an approved plan if
its independent system operator has not approved an outage that would be required to
timely implement the plan.
(G) The resiliency plan must include an executive summary or comprehensive chart that
explains the plan objectives, the resiliency events or related risks the plan is designed to
address, the plan’s proposed resiliency measures, the proposed metrics or criteria for
evaluating the plans’ effectiveness, the plan’s cost and benefits, and how the overall plan
is in the public interest.
(3) An electric utility may designate portions of the resiliency plan as critical energy infrastructure
information, as defined by applicable law, and file such portions confidentially.
(d) Commission processing of resiliency plan
(1) Notice and intervention deadline. By the day after it files its application, the electric utility must
provide notice of its filed resiliency plan, including the docket number assigned to the resiliency plan
and the deadline for intervention, in accordance with this paragraph. The intervention deadline is 30
days from the date service of notice is complete. The notice must be provided using a reasonable
method of notice, to:
(A) all municipalities in the electric utility’s service area that have retained original
jurisdiction;
(B) all parties in the electric utility’s base-rate proceeding;
(C) if the resiliency plan is filed by an electric utility operating in an area in Texas that is open
to competition and includes a request for a resiliency cost recovery rider, each retail electric
provider that is authorized by the registration agent to provide service in the electric
utility’s service area;
(D) the Office of Public Utility Counsel. Notice delivered to the Office of Public Utility
Counsel must include a copy of the resiliency plan, excluding critical energy infrastructure
information; and
(E) the independent system operator. Notice delivered to the utility’s independent system
operator must include a copy of the resiliency plan, excluding critical energy infrastructure
information.
(2) Sufficiency of resiliency plan. An application is sufficient if it includes the information required
by subsection (c) of this section and the electric utility has filed proof that notice has been provided
in accordance with this subsection.
(A) Commission staff must review each resiliency plan for sufficiency and file a
recommendation on sufficiency within 28 calendar days after the resiliency plan is filed.
If commission staff recommends the resiliency plan be found deficient, commission staff
must identify the deficiencies in its recommendation. The electric utility will have seven
calendar days to file a response.
(B) If the presiding officer concludes the resiliency plan is deficient, the presiding officer will
file a notice of deficiency and cite the particular requirements with which the resiliency
plan does not comply. The presiding officer must provide the electric utility an opportunity
to amend its resiliency plan. Commission staff must file a recommendation on sufficiency
within 10 calendar days after the filing of an amended resiliency plan, when the amendment 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024
(P 55250)
is filed in response to an order concluding that material deficiencies exist in the resiliency
plan.
(C) If the presiding officer has not filed a written order concluding that material deficiencies
exist in the resiliency plan within 14 working days after a deadline for a recommendation
on sufficiency, the resiliency plan is deemed sufficient.
(3) The commission will approve, modify, or deny a resiliency plan not later than 180 days after a
complete resiliency plan is filed. A resiliency plan is complete once it is deemed sufficient in
accordance with this subsection. The presiding officer must establish a procedural schedule that
will enable the commission to approve, modify, or deny the plan not later than 180 days after a
complete plan is filed. If the resiliency plan is determined to be materially deficient, the presiding
officer must toll the 180-day deadline until a complete application is filed.
(4) Commission review of resiliency plan. In determining whether to approve, deny, or modify a plan,
the commission will consider:
(A) the extent to which the plan is expected to enhance system resiliency, including whether
the plan prioritizes areas of lower performance;
(B) the estimated costs of implementing the measures proposed in the plan; and
(C) whether the plan is in the public interest. The commission will not approve
a plan that is not in the public interest. In evaluating the public interest, the
commission may consider:
(i) the extent to which the plan is expected to enhance system resiliency, including:
(I) the verifiability and severity of the resiliency risks posed by the
resiliency events the resiliency plan is designed to address;
(II) the extent to which the plan will enhance resiliency of the electric
utility’s system, mitigate system restoration costs, reduce the frequency
or duration of outages, or improve overall service reliability for
customers during and following a resiliency event;
(III) the extent to which the resiliency plan prioritizes areas of lower
performance;
(IV) the extent to which the resiliency plan prioritizes critical load as defined
in §25.52 of this title (relating to Reliability and Continuity of Service);
(ii) the estimated time and costs of implementing the measures proposed in the
resiliency plan;
(iii) whether there are more efficient, cost-effective, or otherwise superior means of
preventing, withstanding, mitigating, or more promptly recovering from the risks
posed by the resiliency events addressed by the resiliency plan; or
(iv) other factors deemed relevant by the commission.
(5) The commission’s denial of a resiliency plan is not a finding on the prudence or imprudence of a
measure or estimated cost in the resiliency plan. Upon denial of a resiliency plan, an electric utility
may file a revised resiliency plan for review and approval by the commission.
(e) Good cause exception. An electric utility must implement each measure in its most recently approved
resiliency plan unless the commission grants a good cause exception to implementing one or more measures
in the plan. The commission may grant a good cause exception if the electric utility demonstrates that
operational needs, business needs, financial conditions, or supply chain or labor conditions dictate the
exception, or if the electric utility has a pending application for a revised resiliency plan that addresses the
same resiliency events.
(f) Resiliency Plan Cost Recovery. A utility may request cost recovery for costs associated with a resiliency
plan approved under this section that are not otherwise included in the utility’s rates. If a utility that files a
resiliency plan with the commission does not apply for a rider or rates to recover resiliency plan costs under
paragraph (1) of this subsection, after commission review and approval of the resiliency plan, the utility may
defer all or a portion of the distribution-related costs relating to the implementation of the resiliency plan for
recovery as a regulatory asset under paragraph (2) of this subsection, or in a base-rate proceeding. The 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024
(P 55250)
regulatory asset may include associated depreciation expense and carrying costs at the utility’s weighted
average cost of capital established in the commission’s final order in the utility’s most recent base-rate
proceeding in a manner consistent with PURA Chapter 36.
(1) Resiliency Cost Recovery Rider. This paragraph provides a mechanism for an electric utility to
request to recover certain resiliency-related costs through a resiliency cost recovery rider (RCRR)
outside of a base-rate proceeding or a distribution cost recovery proceeding as part of a resiliency
plan approved under this section, consistent with Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §38.078(i).
(A) RCRR Requirements. The RCRR rate for each rate class, and any other terms or
conditions related to those rates, will be specified in a rider to the utility’s tariff.
(i) An electric utility must not have more than one RCRR.
(ii) An electric utility with an existing RCRR may apply to amend the RCRR to
include additional costs associated with an updated resiliency plan under PURA
§38.078(g).
(iii) An electric utility may request an RCRR established under this section take effect
at any time, except that before an RCRR established under this section may take
effect:
(I) all distribution investment included in the RCRR must be providing
service to the electric utility’s customers, and
(II) the commission must approve RCRR rates in accordance with clause (iv)
of this subparagraph.
(iv) An electric utility must submit a separate application requesting RCRR rates.
(I) The utility must provide notice of its application, using a reasonable
method of notice, to the parties listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.
(II) The RCRR rate request must include: the final amount of resiliencyrelated distribution invested capital closed to plant and in service to be
included in the RCRR rates, values necessary to calculate RCRR rates,
attachments demonstrating the calculation of RCRR rates consistent with
this section, and workpapers supporting the application.
(III) The commission will enter a final order on the application for RCRR
rates under this section not later than the 60th day after the date the
complete updated request is filed. The commission may extend the
deadline for not more than 30 days for good cause.
(v) An electric utility must provide notice, using a reasonable method of notice, of
the approved rates and effective date of the approved rates to retail electric
providers that are authorized by the registration agent to provide service in the
electric utility’s distribution service area not later than the 45th day before the date
the rates take effect.
(vi) As part of its next base-rate proceeding or distribution cost recovery factor
proceeding for the electric utility, the electric utility may request to include its
remaining unrecovered costs included in its RCRR in that proceeding and must
request that RCRR rates be set to zero as of the effective date of rates resulting
from that proceeding.
(B) Calculation of RCRR Rates. The RCRR rate for each rate class must be calculated
according to the provisions of this subparagraph and subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this
paragraph.
(i) The RCRR rate for each rate class will be calculated using the following formula:
RCRRCLASS = RRCLASS / BDC-CLASS
(ii) The values of the terms used in this paragraph will be calculated as follows:
(I) RRCLASS = RRTOT * ALLOCC-CLASS
(II) RRTOT = ((RNDC * RORRC) + RDDEPR + RNDCFIT + RDOT) -
IDCCR
(III) ALLOCC-CLASS =
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS

resiliency-related net distribution invested capital as well as
appropriate associated ad valorem tax expense.
(III) Baseline values. The following values are based on those values used
to establish rates in the electric utility’s most recent base-rate proceeding
or distribution cost recovery factor proceeding, or if an input to the
RCRR calculation from the electric utility’s most recently completed
base-rate proceeding is not separately identified in that proceeding, it
will be derived from information from that proceeding:
(-a-) BDRC-CLASS -- Rate class billing determinants used to establish
distribution base rates in the most recently completed base-rate
proceeding. Energy-based billing determinants will be used for
those rate classes that do not include any demand charges, and
demand-based billing determinants will be used for those rate
classes that include demand charges.
(-b-) RORRC -- After-tax rate of return approved by the commission
in the electric utility’s most recently completed base-rate
proceeding.
(-c-) ALLOCRC-CLASS -- Rate class allocation factor value
determined under the provisions of subparagraph (C) of this
paragraph.
(-d-) DCRFLGA -- The value of Σ(DISTREVRC-CLASS *
%GROWTHCLASS) in the most recent distribution cost recovery
factor proceeding for the utility since its most recently
completed base-rate proceeding, or zero if there are no
distribution cost recovery factor proceedings since the utility’s
most recently completed base-rate proceeding.

Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024
(P 55250)
(C) Class allocation factors. For calculating RCRR rates, the baseline rate-class allocation
factors used to allocate distribution invested capital in the most recently completed baserate proceeding will be used.
(D) Customer classification. For the purposes of establishing RCRR rates, customers will be
classified according to the rate classes established in the electric utility’s most recently
completed base-rate proceeding.
(2) Distribution Cost Recovery Factor. This paragraph provides a mechanism for an electric utility
to request to recover certain resiliency-related costs deferred as a regulatory asset as part of a
distribution cost recovery factor proceeding under §25.243 of this title (relating to Distribution Cost
Recovery Factor (DCRF)), consistent with PURA §38.078(k).
(A) Notwithstanding the existing requirements of §25.243 of this title, a utility eligible to
request a distribution cost recovery factor under §25.243 of this title must, as part of an
application under §25.243 of this title, request to include any resiliency-related costs
deferred as a regulatory asset under this subsection in its DCRF rates.
(B) DCRF rates established consistent with this paragraph must be calculated in a manner
identical to the DCRF rates described in §25.234 of this title, with the exception that the
DCRF rate for each rate class must be calculated using the following formula:
[((DICC - DICRC) * RORAT) + (DEPRC – DEPRRC) + (FITC – FITRC) + (OTC – OTRC) +
RAMORT – Σ (DISTREVRC-CLASS * %GROWTHCLASS)] * ALLOCCLASS / BDC-CLASS
Where the value of RAMORT must be equal to a reasonable annual amortization amount
of the resiliency-related regulatory asset.
(C) Upon the establishment of an DCRF rate under this paragraph, the resiliency-related
regulatory asset balance will be reduced at an annual rate by the value of RAMORT.
(3) Reconciliation.
(A) Resiliency-related amounts recovered through rates approved under this subsection are
subject to reconciliation in the first base-rate proceeding for the electric utility that is filed
after the effective date of the rates. As part of the reconciliation, the commission will
determine if the resiliency-related costs are reasonable, necessary, and prudent.
(B) Any amounts recovered through rates approved under this subsection that are found to have
been unreasonable, unnecessary, or imprudent, plus the corresponding return and taxes,
must be refunded with carrying costs. In any proceeding in which the commission
determines that a utility has included in rates any amounts deemed unreasonable,
unnecessary, or imprudent, the commission may order a compliance proceeding to
determine the amounts and manner of any necessary refunds to ratepayers, including
carrying costs. Carrying costs will be determined as follows:
(i) For the time period beginning with the date on which over-recovery is determined
to have begun to the effective date of the electric utility’s base rates set in the
base-rate proceeding in which the costs are reconciled, carrying costs will accrue
monthly and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate based on
the same rate of return that was applied to the resiliency costs included in rates.
(ii) For the time period beginning with the effective date of the electric utility’s rates
set in the base-rate proceeding in which the costs are reconciled, carrying costs
will accrue monthly and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate
based on the electric utility’s rate of return authorized in that base-rate proceeding.
(D) In any base-rate proceeding in which resiliency-related costs are being reconciled, the
electric utility must separately include as part of its base-rate application testimony,
schedules and workpapers sufficient to enable a comprehensive review of all resiliencyrelated costs included in each and every rider under this subsection that have not yet been
reconciled. Such information must include, but is not limited to, the dates when the
individual resiliency-related projects began providing service to the public, as well as the
costs associated with the individual resiliency-related projects.
(g) Reporting requirements. An electric utility with a commission-approved resiliency plan must file an annual 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter C. INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIABLITY.
Effective 2/08/2024

resiliency plan report must include the following information:
(1) until the resiliency plan is fully implemented, an implementation status update consisting of:
(A) a list of each resiliency plan measure completed in the prior calendar year, and the actual
capital costs and operations and maintenance expenses incurred in the prior year
attributable to each measure;
(B) a list of each resiliency plan measure scheduled for completion in the upcoming year, and
an estimate of capital costs and operations and maintenance expenses for each resiliency
plan measure scheduled for completion in the upcoming calendar year; and

frequency and magnitude of these events with any projections contained in the resiliency
plan or a resiliency plan previously-implemented by the electric utility;
(B) an evaluation of the effectiveness of each implemented resiliency plan measure in
preventing, withstanding, mitigating, or more promptly recovering from the risks posed by
any resiliency events that measure was implemented to address. This evaluation must
include an analysis using the metric or criteria contained in the resiliency plan for that
measure, and a comparison of the measure’s actual effectiveness with its projected
effectiveness;
(C) an update on the expected impact of implemented resiliency plan measures, as appropriate
for each measure, on system restoration costs, reduction in the frequency or duration of
outages for customers at the location for which a resiliency plan was implemented, and any
improvement in the overall service reliability for customers.
(3) When submitting an updated resiliency plan, the utility must include in the evidence supporting the
plan, any information from prior resiliency benefit updates related to previously-approved measures
designed to address the same or similar resiliency risks.
(4) An electric utility is required to maintain records associated with the information referred to in this
subsection for five years, beginning the year after the plan is approved. Upon request by
commission staff an electric utility must provide any additional information and updates on the
status of the resiliency plan submitted.

(C) An electric utility operating solely outside of the ERCOT region may, but is not required
to, obtain a certificate to install, own, or operate a generation facility with a capacity of 10
megawatts or less.
(3) Electric transmission line. All new electric transmission lines must be reported to the commission
in accordance with §25.83 of this title (relating to Transmission Construction Reports). This
reporting requirement is also applicable to new electric transmission lines to be constructed by an
MPE seeking to directly or indirectly construct, install, or extend a transmission facility outside of
its applicable boundaries. For an MOU, the applicable boundaries are the municipal boundaries of
the municipality that owns the MOU. For an MPA, the applicable boundaries are the municipal
boundaries of the public entities participating in the MPA.
(A) Determination of need:
(i) Economic projects. Except as otherwise stated in this subparagraph, the
following must be met for a transmission line in the ERCOT region. The applicant
must present an economic cost-benefit study that analyzes the transmission
project under a congestion cost savings test and a production cost savings test.
The commission will give great weight to such a study if it is conducted by the
ERCOT independent system operator. Adequately quantifiable and ongoing
direct and indirect costs and benefits to the transmission system attributable to the
project may be included in the cost-benefit study.
(I) Congestion cost savings test. ERCOT, in consultation with commission
staff, must develop a congestion cost savings test.
(-a-) The congestion cost savings test must include an analysis of
whether the levelized ERCOT-wide annual congestion cost
savings attributable to the proposed project are equal to or
greater than the average of the first three years annual revenue
requirement of the proposed project of which the transmission
line is a part.
(-b-) Prior to the effective date of the test developed by ERCOT
under this subclause ERCOT may immediately, without
updating its current protocols, utilize the generator revenue
reduction test, effective Dec. 1, 2011 under ERCOT Nodal
Protocols §3.11.2(6), as the congestion cost benefit test required
under this clause. ERCOT may continue to rely upon
completed calculations using the generator revenue reduction
test to evaluate ongoing applications after the effective date of
the test developed under this subclause.
(II) Production cost savings test. The production cost savings test must
include an analysis of whether the levelized ERCOT-wide annual
production cost savings attributable to the proposed project are equal to 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 12/20/2022
(P 53403)
or greater than the first-year annual revenue requirement of the proposed
project of which the transmission line is a part.
(III) Economic cost-benefit analysis must be studied for the projected inservice date of the project using the study case identified in the ERCOT
planning guide.
(IV) ERCOT may recommend, and the commission may approve, a
transmission line in the ERCOT region that demonstrates a savings under
either a congestion cost savings test or a production cost savings test.
(ii) Reliability projects.
(I) The requirements of clause (i) of this subparagraph do not apply to an
application for a transmission line that is necessary to meet state or
federal reliability standards, including: a transmission line needed to
interconnect a transmission service customer or end-use customer; or
needed due to the requirements of any federal, state, county, or municipal
government body or agency for purposes including, but not limited to,
highway transportation, airport construction, public safety, or air or
water quality.
(II) For a transmission line not addressed by clause (i) of this subparagraph,
the commission will consider, among other factors, the needs of the
interconnected transmission systems to support a reliable and adequate
network and to facilitate robust wholesale competition. When evaluating
reliability for a proposed project in the ERCOT region, the commission
will consider and any review conducted by ERCOT must incorporate the
historical load, forecasted load growth, and additional load currently
seeking interconnection. The forecasted load growth and additional load
currently seeking interconnection must be substantiated by quantifiable
evidence of projected load growth. The commission will give great
weight to:
(-a-) the recommendation of an organization that meets the
requirement of PURA §39.151; and/or
(-b-) written documentation provided by a transmission service
provider to ERCOT that the transmission line is needed to
interconnect transmission service or retail customers.
(iii) Resiliency. ERCOT may recommend, and the commission may approve, a
transmission project that is submitted as an economic or reliability project and
does not demonstrate sufficient economic savings or reliability benefits to merit
approval on those grounds if ERCOT determines the line would address a
resiliency issue identified in the grid reliability and resiliency assessment required
by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. In determining whether to approve such a
project the commission will consider:
(I) the margin by which the transmission project was unable to demonstrate
sufficient economic savings or reliability benefits to merit approval on
those grounds;
(II) whether the resiliency benefits the transmission project would provide
by reducing the impacts to customers of potential outages caused by
regional extreme weather scenarios are sufficient to compensate for the
project’s inability to demonstrate sufficient economic savings or
reliability benefits to merit approval on those grounds.
(III) the cost effectiveness of the transmission project’s ability to address the
resiliency issue identified by ERCOT compared to other possible 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 12/20/2022
(P 53403)
solutions,
(IV) other factors listed in PURA §37.056(c), as appropriate.
(B) Routing: An application for a new transmission line must address the criteria in PURA
§37.056(c) and considering those criteria, engineering constraints, and costs, the line must
be routed to the extent reasonable to moderate the impact on the affected community and
landowners unless grid reliability and security dictate otherwise. The following factors
must be considered in the selection of the utility’s alternative routes unless a route is agreed
to by the utility, the landowners whose property is crossed by the proposed line, and owners
of land that contains a habitable structure within 300 feet of the centerline of a transmission
project of 230 kV or less, or within 500 feet of the centerline of a transmission project
greater than 230 kV, and otherwise conforms to the criteria in PURA §37.056(c):
(i) whether the routes parallel or utilize existing compatible rights-of-way for electric
facilities, including the use of vacant positions on existing multiple- circuit
transmission lines;
(ii) whether the routes parallel or utilize other existing compatible rights-of- way,
including roads, highways, railroads, or telephone utility rights-of-way;
(iii) whether the routes parallel property lines or other natural or cultural features; and
(iv) whether the routes conform with the policy of prudent avoidance.
(C) Uncontested transmission lines: An application for a certificate for a transmission line
will be approved administratively within 80 days from the date of filing a complete
application if:
(i) no motion to intervene has been filed or the application is uncontested; and
(ii) commission staff has determined that the application is complete and meets all
applicable statutory criteria and filing requirements, including, but not limited to,
the provision of proper notice of the application.
(D) Projects deemed critical to reliability. Applications for transmission lines which have
been formally designated by a PURA §39.151 organization as critical to the reliability of
the system will be considered by the commission on an expedited basis. The commission
will render a decision approving or denying an application for a certificate under this
subparagraph within 180 days of the date of filing a complete application for such a
certificate unless good cause is shown for extending that period.
(E) Grid reliability and resiliency assessment. ERCOT must conduct a biennial assessment
of the ERCOT power grid’s reliability and resiliency in extreme weather scenarios. Each
assessment must:
(i) consider the impact of different levels of thermal and renewable generation
availability;
(ii) identify areas of the state that face significant grid reliability and resiliency issues,
taking into account the impact of potential outages caused by regional extreme
weather scenarios on customers, including multiple element outage analysis when
appropriate, and
(iii) recommend transmission projects that may increase the grid’s reliability or
resiliency in extreme weather scenarios.
(4) Tie line. An application for a tie line must include a study of the tie line by ERCOT. The study
must include, at a minimum, an ERCOT-approved reliability assessment of the proposed tie line. If
an independent system operator intends to conduct a study to evaluate a proposed tie line or intends
to provide confidential information to another entity to permit the study of a proposed tie line, the
independent system operator must file notice with the commission at least 45 days prior to the
commencement of such a study or the provision of such information.

interconnect a new natural gas generation facility to the ERCOT transmission grid and for which,
on or before January 1, 2015, an MOU was contractually obligated to purchase at least 190
megawatts of capacity.
(d) Standards of construction and operation. In determining standard practice, the commission will be guided
by the provisions of the American National Standards Institute, Incorporated, the National Electrical Safety
Code, and such other codes and standards that are generally accepted by the industry, except as modified by
this commission or by municipal regulations within their jurisdiction. Each electric utility must construct,
install, operate, and maintain its plant, structures, equipment, and lines in accordance with these standards,
and in such manner to best accommodate the public, and to prevent interference with service furnished by
other public utilities insofar as practical.
(1) The standards of construction apply to, but are not limited to, the construction of any new electric
transmission facilities, rebuilding, upgrading, or relocation of existing electric transmission
facilities.
(2) For electric transmission line construction requiring the acquisition of new rights-of-way, an electric
utility must include in the easement agreement, at a minimum, a provision prohibiting the new
construction of any above-ground structures within the right-of-way. For this purpose, new
construction of above-ground structures does not include necessary repairs to existing structures,
farm or livestock facilities, storage barns, hunting structures, small personal storage sheds, or similar
structures. A utility may negotiate appropriate exceptions in instances where the electric utility is
subject to a restrictive agreement being granted by a governmental agency or within the constraints
of an industrial site. Any exception to this paragraph must meet all applicable requirements of the
National Electrical Safety Code.
(3) Measures must be applied when appropriate to mitigate the adverse impacts of the construction of
any new electric transmission facilities, and the rebuilding, upgrading, or relocation of existing
electric transmission facilities. Mitigation measures must be adapted to the specifics of each project
and may include such requirements as:
(A) selective clearing of the right-of-way to minimize the amount of flora and fauna disturbed;

adequate electric service includes continuous and reliable electric service as defined in this section.
If the executive director issues a cease and desist order suspending a REP’s ability to acquire new
customers without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing, the procedural provisions of
§25.54(d)(2) of this title (relating to Cease and Desist Orders) apply.
(3) In addition to any other applicable requirements, an order suspending a REP’s ability to acquire new
customers must describe the conduct of the of the REP and the significant violations that support
the issuance of the order. The order must also describe any conditions the REP must meet for
reinstatement.
(4) If appropriate, an order suspending a REP’s ability to acquire new customers may also include
specific, verifiable conditions for expedited reinstatement. The conditions for expedited
reinstatement may require actions beyond those required to come into compliance with applicable
law and may include verification from commission staff that the conditions for expedited
reinstatement have been met, verification that commission staff has not identified any reasons the
suspension should remain in effect, or a deadline for meeting one or more of the conditions.
Expedited reinstatement is not appropriate if the basis for the suspension cannot be redressed by the
fulfillment of specific, predetermined remedial actions, if the pattern of conduct giving rise to the
suspension supports a general concern about the REP’s ability to comply with applicable law or
provide customers with continuous and reliable service, or if there is evidence that may support
additional grounds for suspension. If appropriate, a compliance docket will be opened for filings
relevant to this paragraph. If the REP fulfills the conditions for expedited reinstatement and files
all required supporting documentation, commission staff must lift the suspension, notify ERCOT of
the reinstatement, and file a notice of reinstatement as soon as practicable. If commission staff
verification is required and commission staff does not agree that expedited reinstatement is
appropriate under the terms of the suspension order, the REP may seek reinstatement under
paragraph (6) of this subsection.
(5) A REP that has its ability to acquire new customers suspended must cease, within three working
days, the solicitation or enrollment of new customers and the applicable independent organization
will be directed to report to commission staff, on a weekly basis, any new customers that have been
added by the REP. In this subparagraph, the term “enrollment” means the act of executing a contract
with an applicant for the provision of electric service but does not include renewing the contract of
an existing customer.
(6) A REP may request reinstatement by filing a petition for reinstatement. The commission delegates
authority to the presiding officer to approve a petition for reinstatement under this subsection with
a notice of approval in accordance with §22.35(b)(1) of this title. In determining whether to lift the
suspension, the presiding officer may consider, as appropriate, whether:
(A) the REP has resolved all violations underlying the suspension and fulfilled all conditions
for reinstatement;
(B) the REP is in compliance with all or specific individual technical, managerial, and financial
requirements in this section; and
(C) there exist any additional grounds that would support the suspension of the REPs ability to
acquire new customers under this subsection.
(7) A REP subject to suspension of acquiring new customers under this section must continue to serve
existing customers and maintain compliance with PURA, commission substantive rules, and
protocols adopted by the applicable independent organization. Suspension of the ability to acquire
new customers does not impact a REP’s obligation to timely initiate service to a customer that
completed enrollment with the REP prior to the effective date of the suspension, even if the
scheduled service initiation date falls within the suspension period.

Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 8/15/00
§25.108. Financial Standards for Retail Electric Providers Regarding the Billing and Collection of
Transition Charges.
(a) Application. This section applies to any retail electric provider (REP) or any other entity responsible for
billing and collecting transition charges serving customers in a transmission and distribution utility (TDU)
service area subject to a financing order issued by the commission under Public Utility Regulatory Act
(PURA) §39.303.
(b) Definitions.
(1) Financing order – An order of the commission adopted under PURA §39.201 or §39.262 approving
the issuance of transition bonds and the creation of transition charges for the recovery of qualified
costs.
(2) Indenture trustee – An entity that administers the indenture related to transition bonds.
(3) Servicer – The entity responsible for carrying out obligations related to transition bonds under a
servicing agreement.
(4) Servicing agreement – The agreement that details the obligations of the servicer related to the
imposition, collection, and remittance of transition charges.
(5) Special purpose entity (SPE) – An entity formed by an electric utility, pursuant to a financing order,
for the limited purpose of acquiring transition property, issuing transition bonds, and performing other
activities relating thereto or otherwise authorized by a financing order.
(6) Transition bonds – Bonds, debentures, notes, certificates, of participation or of beneficial interest, or
other evidences of indebtedness or ownership that are issued by an electric utility, its successors, or
an assignee under a financing order, that have a term not longer than 15 years, and that are secured or
payable from transition property.
(7) Transition charges – Nonbypassable amounts to be charged for the use or availability of electric
services, approved by the commission under a financing order to recover qualified costs, that shall be
collected by an electric utility, its successors, an assignee, or other collection agents as provided for in
a financing order.
(c) Applicability of REP standards. Beginning on the date of customer choice for any retail customers, the
servicer of the transition bonds will bill the transition charges for those customers to each retail customer’s
REP and the REP will collect transition charges from its retail customers. The standards in this section are
the most stringent that can be imposed on REPs by any servicer of transition bonds. The standards relate
only to the billing and collection of transition charges authorized by a financing order and do not apply to the
collection of any other non-bypassable charges, or any other charges. The standards apply to all REPs other
than REPs that have contracted with the transmission and distribution company to bill and collect transition
charges from retail customers. REPs may contract with parties other than the transmission and distribution
company to bill and collect transition charges from retail customers, but such REPs shall remain subject to
the standards in this section.
(d) REP standards. The REP standards for transition charges are:
(1) Rating, deposit, and related requirements. A REP that does not have or maintain the requisite longterm, unsecured credit rating may select which alternate form of deposit, credit support, or
combination thereof it will utilize, in its sole discretion. The indenture trustee shall be the beneficiary
of any affiliate guarantee, surety bond or letter of credit. The provider of any affiliate guarantee, surety
bond, or letter of credit must have and maintain a long-term, unsecured credit ratings of not less than
“BBB-” and “Baa3” (or the equivalent) from Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors
Service (“Moody’s”), respectively. Each REP must:
(A) have a long-term, unsecured credit rating of not less than “BBB-” and “Baa3” (or the equivalent)
from S&P and Moody’s , respectively; or
(B) provide:
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 8/15/00
(i) a deposit of two months’ maximum expected transition charge collections in the form of
cash,
(ii) an affiliate guarantee, surety bond, or letter of credit providing for payment of such
amount of transition-charge collections in the event that the REP defaults in its payment
obligations, or
(iii) a combination of clause (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.
(2) Loss of credit rating. If the long-term, unsecured credit rating from either S&P or Moody’s of a REP
that did not previously provide the alternate form of deposit, credit support, or combination thereof or
of any provider of an affiliate guarantee, surety bond, or letter of credit is suspended, withdrawn, or
downgraded below “BBB-” or “Baa3” (or the equivalent), the REP must provide the alternate form of
deposit, credit support, or combination thereof, or new forms thereof, in each case from providers with
the requisite ratings, within ten business days following such suspension, withdrawal, or downgrade.
A REP failing to make such provision must comply with the provisions set forth in paragraph (5) of
this subsection.
(3) Computation of deposit. The computation of the size of a required deposit shall be agreed upon by
the servicer and the REP, and reviewed during the first month of each calendar quarter to ensure that
the deposit accurately reflects two months’ maximum collections. If the REP provides a cash deposit,
then within ten business days following such review, the REP shall remit to the indenture trustee the
amount of any shortfall in such required deposit, or the servicer shall instruct the indenture trustee to
remit to the REP any amount in excess of such required deposit. If the REP provides security in the
form of a letter of credit or surety bond then within ten business days following such review, the REP
shall submit replacement letters of credit or surety bonds in the amount determined pursuant to the
review. A REP failing to so remit any such shortfall or failing to submit replacement letters of credit
or surety bonds, as applicable, must comply with the provisions set forth in paragraph (5) of this
subsection. REP cash deposits shall be held by the indenture trustee, as a collateral agent for the REP
and the indenture trustee (in its capacity as indenture trustee) and shall be maintained in a segregated
account which shall not be part of the trust estate, and invested in short-term high quality investments,
as permitted by the rating agencies rating the transition bonds. Investment earnings on REP cash
deposits shall be considered part of such cash deposits so long as they remain on deposit with the
indenture trustee. At the instruction of the servicer, cash deposits will be remitted with investment
earnings to the REP at the end of the term of the transition bonds unless otherwise utilized for the
payment of the REP’s obligations for transition bond payments. Once the deposit is no longer
required, the servicer shall promptly (but not later than 30 calendar days) instruct the indenture trustee
to remit the amounts in the segregated accounts to the REP.
(4) Payment of transition charges. Payments of transition charges less the charge-off allowance
described in paragraph (9) of this subsection are due 35 calendar days following each billing by the
servicer to the REP, without regard to whether or when the REP receives payment from its retail
customers. The servicer shall accept payment by electronic funds transfer, wire transfer, and/or check.
Payment will be considered received the date the electronic funds transfer or wire transfer is received
by the servicer, or the date the check clears. A 5.0% penalty is to be charged on amounts received
after 35 calendar days; however, a ten calendar-day grace period will be allowed before the REP is
considered to be in default. A REP in default must comply with the provisions set forth in paragraph
(5) of this subsection. The 5.0% penalty will be a one-time assessment measured against the current
amount overdue from the REP to the servicer. The “current amount” consists of the total unpaid
transition charges existing on the 36th calendar day after billing by the servicer. Any and all such
penalty payments will be made to the indenture trustee to be applied against transition charge
obligations. A REP shall not be obligated to pay the overdue transition charges of another REP. If a
REP agrees to assume the responsibility for the payment of overdue transition charges as a condition
of receiving the customers of another REP that has decided to terminate service to those customers for
any reason, the new REP shall not be assessed the 5.0% penalty upon such transition charges; however,
the prior REP shall not be relieved of the previously-assessed penalties.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 8/15/00
(5) Remedies upon default. After the ten calendar-day grace period (the 45th calendar day after the
billing date) referred to in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the servicer shall have the option to seek
recourse against any cash deposit, affiliate guarantee, surety bond, letter of credit, or combination
thereof provided by the REP, and to avail itself of such legal remedies as may be appropriate to collect
any remaining unpaid transition charges and associated penalties due the servicer after the application
of the REP’s deposit or alternate form of credit support. In addition, a REP that is in default with
respect to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection shall select and
implement one of the options listed in subparagraphs (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph. If a REP that
is in default fails to immediately select and implement one of these options or, after so selecting one
of the options, fails to adequately meet its responsibilities thereunder, then the servicer shall
immediately implement the option in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Upon re-establishment of
compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection, and the
payment of all past-due amounts and associated penalties, the REP will no longer be required to
comply with this paragraph.
(A) Allow the Provider of Last Resort (“POLR”) or a qualified REP of the customer’s choosing to
immediately assume the responsibility for the billing and collection of transition charges.
(B) Immediately implement other mutually suitable and agreeable arrangements with the servicer.
It is expressly understood that the servicer’s ability to agree to any other arrangements will be
limited by the terms of the securitization Servicing Agreement and requirements of each of the
rating agencies that have rated the transition bonds necessary to avoid a suspension, withdrawal,
or downgrade of the ratings on the transition bonds.
(C) Arrange that all amounts owed by retail customers for services rendered by the REP be timely
billed and will immediately be paid directly into a lock-box controlled by the servicer with such
amounts to be applied first to pay transition charges and other non-bypassable delivery charges
before the remaining amounts are released to the REP. All costs associated with this mechanism
will be borne solely by the REP.
(6) Billing by providers of last resort. The initial POLR appointed by the commission, or any
commission-appointed successor to the POLR, must meet the minimum credit rating or deposit/credit
support requirements described in paragraph (1) of this subsection in addition to any other standards
that may be adopted by the commission. If the POLR defaults or is not eligible to provide such
services, responsibility for billing and collection of transition charges will immediately be transferred
to and assumed by the servicer until a new POLR can be named by the commission or the customer
requests the services of a certified REP. If the POLR or a qualified REP assumes responsibility for
billing and collecting transition charges under paragraph (5) of this subsection or servicer assumes
such responsibility under this paragraph, the POLR, replacement REP, or servicer, as applicable shall
bill all transition charges which have not been billed as of the date it assumes such responsibility and
shall be subject to the provisions of the financing order. (For example, if a REP which bills on a
calendar month basis goes into default and is replaced by the POLR on April 20, the initial transition
charge bill rendered by the POLR would cover all transition charges attributable to periods since
March 31, the last date for which the original REP had rendered bills). Retail customers may never
be re-billed by the successor REP, the POLR, or the servicer for any amount of transition charges they
have paid their REP (although future transition charges shall reflect REP and other system-wide
charge-offs). Additionally, if the amount of the penalty detailed in paragraph (4) of this subsection is
the sole remaining past-due amount after the 45th calendar day, the REP shall not be required to
comply with paragraph (5)(A), (B) or (C) of this subsection, unless the penalty is not paid within an
additional 30 calendar days.
(7) Dispute resolution. In the event that a REP disputes any amount of billed transition charges, the REP
shall pay the disputed amount under protest according to the timelines detailed in paragraph (4) of this
subsection. The REP and servicer shall first attempt to informally resolve the dispute, but if they fail
to do so within 30 calendar days, either party may file a complaint with the commission. If the REP
is successful in the dispute process (informal or formal), the REP shall be entitled to interest on the
disputed amount paid to the servicer at the commission-approved interest rate. Disputes about the date 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 8/15/00
of receipt of transition charge payments (and penalties arising thereof) or the size of a required REP
deposit will be handled in a like manner. It is expressly intended that any interest paid by the servicer
on disputed amounts shall not be recovered through transition charges if it is determined that the
servicer’s claim to the funds is clearly unfounded. No interest shall be paid by the servicer if it is
determined that the servicer has received inaccurate metering data from another entity providing
competitive metering services pursuant to PURA §39.107.
(8) Metering data. If the servicer is providing the metering, metering data will be provided to the REP
at the same time as the billing. The REP will be responsible for providing the servicer accurate
metering data (including meter identification information) for all REP’s customers whose meters are
not read by the servicer at the time the data is provider to the independent organization (as defined in
PURA §39.151(b)) under the independent organization’s protocols for settlement.
(9) Charge-off allowances. The REP will be allowed to hold back an allowance for charge-offs in its
payments to the servicer. Such charge-off rate will be recalculated each year in connection with the
annual true-up procedure. In the initial year, REPs will be allowed to remit payments based on the
same system-wide charge-off percentage then being used by the servicer to remit payments to the
indenture trustee for the holders of transition bonds; thereafter the charge-off percentage will be
calculated based upon each REP’s prior year charge-off experience. On an annual basis in connection
with the true-up process, the REP and the servicer will be responsible for reconciling the amounts held
back with amounts actually written off as uncollectible in accordance with the terms agreed to by the
REP and the servicer, provided that:
(A) The REP’s right to reconciliation for charge-offs will be limited to customers whose service has
been permanently terminated and whose entire accounts (i.e., all amounts due the REP for its
own account as well as the portion representing transition charges) have been written off.
(B) If the REP’s actual charge-offs are greater than the allowance for charge-offs, the REP may
collect the difference, with interest, from the date the review was completed, in 12 equal monthly
installments beginning in the month that the transition charges are adjusted to reflect the new
charge off percentages. The REP’s recourse will be limited to a credit against future transition
charge payments unless the REP and the servicer agree to alternative arrangements, but in no
event will the REP have recourse to the indenture trustee, the “SPE” or the SPE’s funds for such
payments and the indenture trustee and SPE shall not be liable for such amounts. If the REP’s
actual charge-offs are less than the allowance for charge-offs, the REP shall pay the difference,
with interest, from the date the review was completed, in 12 equal monthly installments
beginning in the month that the transition charges are adjusted to reflect the new charge-off
percentages. The interest rate on amounts due to or from the REP under this paragraph shall be
the interest rate in effect pursuant to Texas Utilities Code §183.003 on the date the annual
reconciliation is made. REP and servicer shall each have the unilateral right to prepay any
amounts due hereunder and thus avoid continued accrual of interest.
(C) The REP shall provide ‘ the servicer a list of all charge-offs qualifying for reconciliation under
subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, and documentation permitting servicer to verify that service
to the customer has been terminated and all amounts due the REP from such customers have
been written off. The information shall be provided not later than 30 days prior to the date on
which the annual true-up adjustment is to be filed and shall cover the most recent 12-month
period for which data is available at the time of submission. The information to be provided by
the REP shall include data demonstrating that the REP has not collected any amounts the REP
claimed as charge-offs in prior periods, or, if any amount previously charged-off has been
collected, quantifying the revenues. The REP’s rights to credits will not take effect until adjusted
transition charges reflecting the REPs charge-off experience have been implemented.
(10) Service termination. In the event that the servicer is billing customers for transition charges, the
servicer shall have the right to terminate transmission and distribution service to the end-use customer
(or if the servicer is not the transmission and distribution utility to direct the transmission and
distribution utility to terminate service to the end-use customer) for non-payment by the end-use
customer pursuant to applicable commission rules. In the event that a REP or the POLR is billing 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 8/15/00
customers for transition charges, the REP shall have the right to transfer the customer to the POLR (or
to another certified REP) or to direct the transmission and distribution utility to terminate transmission
and distribution service to the end-use customer for non-payment by the end-use customer pursuant to
applicable commission rules. In the event that the POLR is billing customers for transition charges,
the POLR shall have the right to direct the transmission and distribution utility to terminate
transmission and distribution service to the end-use customer for non-payment by the end-use
customer pursuant to applicable commission rules.
(11) Precedence and modifications of REP standards in a financing order.
(A) Compliance with financing order standards. If the REP standards in the applicable financing
order are in direct conflict with the standards in this section, then the REP must comply with the
REP standards stated in the financing order, instead of the standards stated in this section, unless
the standards of the financing order have been modified and approved according to subparagraph
(B) of this paragraph.
(B) Commission modification of standards. The commission may impose standards on REPs that
are different from those in the applicable financing order but only if the commission receives
prior written confirmation from each rating agency that rated the transition bonds authorized by
that financing order that the proposed modifications will not cause a suspension, withdrawal, or
downgrade of ratings on the transition bonds.

Effective 6/28/00
§25.111. Registration of Aggregators.
(a) Application. Any person, municipality, political subdivision, or political subdivision corporation that
aggregates the loads of two or more electric service customers for purposes of purchasing electricity services
shall register with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (commission) pursuant to this section. A single
electricity customer, including a municipality or political subdivision, negotiating service in multiple
locations for its own use, does not need to register with the commission.
(b) Purpose statement. The role of an aggregator in the restructured electric market is to be a buyer’s agent for
customer groups. An entity that joins customers together as a single purchasing unit and negotiates on their
behalf for the purchase of electricity service in Texas is considered an aggregator and must register pursuant
to this section. In contrast, an entity that sells electricity is a retail electric provider (REP) and is subject to
other commission rules. This section sets out conditions for registering and operating as an aggregator,
including the condition that the aggregator, a buyer’s agent, may not be affiliated with a REP or other seller’s
agent representing the REP.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings,
unless the context indicates otherwise:
(1) Aggregation — to join two or more electricity customers into a purchasing unit to negotiate the
purchase of electricity by the electricity customer as part of a voluntary association of electricity
customers, provided that an electricity customer may not avoid any non-bypassable charges or fees as
a result of aggregating its load.
(2) Aggregator — An entity is an aggregator, as opposed to a consultant, if it conducts any activity that
joins two or more customers into a purchasing unit to negotiate the purchase of electricity from retail
electric providers (REPs). If an entity conducts activities only in the capacity of advisor to a customer
or set of customers, without contact with REPs specific to that customer or customer group, then it is
a consultant that does not need to register pursuant to this section. An aggregator that provides
aggregation services to Texas electricity customers must meet one of the following definitions:
(A) Class I aggregator — a person joining two or more customers, other than municipalities and
political subdivision corporations, into a single purchasing unit to negotiate the purchase of
electricity from REPs.
(B) Class II aggregator — a person or municipality or other political subdivision that provides
aggregation services to municipalities or other political subdivisions in the manner stated below:
(i) A person authorized by two or more municipal governing bodies to join the bodies into
a single purchasing unit to negotiate the purchase of electricity from REPs or a
municipality aggregating under Local Government Code, Chapter 303.
(ii) A person or political subdivision corporation authorized by two or more political
subdivision governing bodies to join the bodies into a single purchasing unit or multiple
purchasing units to negotiate the purchase of electricity from REPs for the facilities of
the aggregated political subdivisions or a person or political subdivision aggregating
under Local Government Code, Chapter 303.
(3) Person — an individual, a partnership of two or more persons having a joint or common interest, a
mutual or cooperative association, or a corporation, but not including a municipal corporation or an
electric cooperative. For purposes of this section, a political subdivision or political subdivision
corporation is not a person.
(4) Political subdivision — a county, municipality, hospital district, or any other political subdivision
receiving electric service from an entity that has implemented customer choice.
(5) Political subdivision corporation — an entity consisting of two or more political subdivisions created
to act as an agent, or otherwise, to negotiate the purchase of electricity for the use of the respective
public facilities in accordance with Local Government Code §303.001.
(6) Proprietary customer information — any information compiled by an aggregator on a customer in
the normal course of aggregating electric service that makes possible the identification of any 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 6/28/00
individual customer by matching such information with the customer’s name, address, account
number, type or classification of service, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, types of
facilities used in providing service, individual contract terms and conditions, price, current charges,
billing records, or any other information that the customer has expressly requested not be disclosed.
Information that is redacted or organized in such a way as to make it impossible to identify the
customer to whom the information relates does not constitute propriety customer information.
(7) Revocation — the cessation of all aggregation business operations in the state of Texas, pursuant to
commission order.
(8) Suspension — the cessation of all aggregation business operations in the state of Texas associated
with obtaining new customers, pursuant to commission order.
(d) Types of aggregator registrations required.
(1) Entities seeking to aggregate electricity customers may not provide aggregation services in the state
unless they have registered with the commission. Such registration may be sought after September 1,
2000.
(2) There are two types of registration available to aggregators. An entity seeking to aggregate under the
terms and conditions set forth in the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.353 shall register as a
“Class I aggregator.” An entity seeking to aggregate under the terms and conditions set forth in PURA
§39.354 or §39.3545, or both, shall register as a “Class II aggregator.” The Class II category of
registration has four subclasses, A through D. The terms of eligibility and operational requirements
for each type of aggregator are specified in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. The registering
party must indicate the Class and subclass, if any, under which it wishes to register. If a person is
eligible and wishes to perform aggregation services under more than one class of registration, it shall
obtain all applicable registrations.
(3) Registration of Class I aggregators. A Class I aggregator may join at least two voluntary customers
into a single purchasing unit to negotiate the purchase of electricity from REPs. A Class I aggregator
shall:
(A) be a person and not a REP;
(B) not be an affiliate of a REP;
(C) not include municipalities, political subdivisions, or political subdivision corporations among
the customers of an aggregation;
(D) not take title to electricity, and not accept any money associated with payment or prepayment
for electric service, as distinguished from aggregation services, unless it does so under contract
with a REP, consistent with any rules adopted by the commission relating to customer billing as
an independent billing agent for a REP;
(E) comply with the customer protection rules, disclosure requirements, and marketing guidelines of
PURA and this title;
(F) comply with any other terms and conditions established by the commission to regulate reliability
and integrity of aggregators.
(4) Registration of Class II aggregators. A Class II aggregator shall not be a REP or an affiliate of a REP
and shall register pursuant to at least one of the following sets of eligibility and operational
requirements:
(A) Class II.A: Person that aggregates municipalities, political subdivisions, or both. A person
registered as a Class II.A aggregator pursuant to this subparagraph may join two or more
authorizing municipal governing bodies into a single purchasing unit to negotiate the purchase
of electricity from REPs, or it may join two or more authorizing political subdivision governing
bodies, including municipal governing bodies, into single or multiple purchasing units to
negotiate the purchase of electricity from REPs for the facilities of the aggregated political
subdivisions. A person aggregating political subdivisions pursuant to this subparagraph may not
take title to electricity. The authorizations shall be written and may specify the buyer’s agent
role of the aggregator to the extent desired by the political subdivision. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 6/28/00
(B) Class II.B: Political subdivision corporation aggregating political subdivisions. A political
subdivision corporation registered as a Class II.B aggregator pursuant to this subparagraph may
join two or more authorizing political subdivision governing bodies, including municipal
governing bodies, into single or multiple purchasing units to negotiate the purchase of electricity
from REPs for the facilities of the aggregated political subdivisions. A political subdivision
corporation aggregating political subdivisions pursuant to this subparagraph may take title to
electricity.
(C) Class II.C: Public body that aggregates its citizens. A municipality or other political
subdivision registered as a Class II.C aggregator pursuant to this subparagraph may negotiate for
the purchase of electricity and energy services on behalf of each affirmatively requesting citizen
of the municipality in accordance with Local Government Code §303.002, with the option to
contract with a third party or another aggregator for the administration of the aggregation of the
purchased services. An affirmatively requesting citizen is a resident of the political subdivision
who voluntarily agrees to participate in the aggregation by a means that may be verified after the
fact. If the Class II.C aggregator contracts for the administration function with a third party that
is a person, other than its own employee, the person must be a registered Class II.D aggregator.
(D) Class II.D: Administrator of citizen aggregation. A person registered as a Class II.D
aggregator pursuant to this subparagraph may administer the aggregation of electricity and
energy services purchased for each requesting citizen of a municipality or other political
subdivision in accordance with Local Government Code §303.002 pursuant to a contract with
the municipality or political subdivision. An affirmatively requesting citizen is a resident of the
political subdivision who voluntarily agrees to participate in the aggregation by a means that
may be verified after the fact. A Class II.D aggregator must have verifiable authorization from
the political subdivision to administer its citizen aggregation program. The authorization shall
be written and may include conditions on the administrator’s transactions with its affiliated REP,
if any, when so specified by the political subdivision. The Class II.D registration authorizes its
holder to administer a citizen aggregation program on behalf of the political subdivision but does
not authorize its holder to negotiate for the purchase of electricity and energy services on behalf
of the citizens of the political subdivision. An administrator of citizen aggregation must register
pursuant to this subparagraph when the administrator meets the definition of “person” under this
section, except when the administrator is an individual employed by the political subdivision
conducting citizen aggregation pursuant to Local Government Code §303.002. A Class II.D
aggregator may not take title to electricity and may not be a REP or an affiliate of a REP.
(e) Requirements for public bodies seeking to register as Class II.B or II.C aggregators. A municipality,
other political subdivision, or political subdivision corporation seeking to register and operate as a Class II.B
or Class II.C aggregator in accordance with this section shall provide the following information on a
registration form approved by the commission. This subsection does not apply to registering parties who are
persons, as defined in this section.
(1) The legal name of the registering party as well as any trade or commercial name(s) under which the
registering party intends to operate;
(2) The registering party’s Texas business address and principal place of business;
(3) The names and business addresses of the registering party’s principal officers;

contact person and for an agent for service of process, if a different person;
(7) The types of electricity customers that the registering party intends to aggregate; and
(8) Any other information required of public bodies on a registration form approved by the commission.

demand electricity. Requirements for registration under this paragraph are as follows:
(A) The person shall provide the commission a signed, notarized affidavit stating that it possesses a
written consent from each customer it wishes to serve, authorizing the person to provide
aggregation services for that customer;
(B) The person shall complete applicable portions of the registration form other than the information

any deposits or other advance payments from electricity customers for aggregation services, as distinguished
from electric services, shall demonstrate financial resources necessary to protect customers from the loss of
deposits or other advance payments through fraud, business failure or other causes. Aggregation services are
distinct from retail electric services. A person registered initially on the basis of not accepting customer

the commission that it is able to comply with the requirements of this subsection in advance of accepting
deposits or other advance payments for aggregation services.
(1) Standard financial qualifications. The amount of required financial resources shall equal the

(v) A loan issued by a subsidiary or affiliate of the applicant or a corporation holding
controlling interest in the applicant, irrevocable for a period of at least 15 months;
(vi) A guaranty issued by a shareholder or principal of the applicant; a subsidiary or affiliate

fund the loan or guaranty.
(C) Unencumbered resources. All cash and other instruments listed in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph as evidence of financial resources shall be unencumbered by pledges for collateral.
These financial resources shall be subject to verification and review prior to registration of the
aggregator and at any time after registration in which the aggregator relies on the cash or other
financial instrument to meet the requirements under this subsection. The resources available to
the aggregator must be authenticated by independent, third party documentation.
(D) Credit ratings. To meet the requirements of this paragraph, a aggregator may rely upon either
its own investment grade credit rating, or a bond, guaranty, or corporate commitment of an
affiliate or another company, if the entity providing such security is also rated investment grade.
The determination of such investment grade quality will be based on the ratings of either
Standard & Poors (S&P) or Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s). If the investment grade credit
rating of either S&P or Moody’s is suspended or withdrawn, the REP must provide alternative
financial evidence consistent with this paragraph within ten days of the credit downgrade.

this section.
(2) Alternative financial qualifications for limited registration. A person seeking registration pursuant
to this paragraph is limited to aggregating only customers who seek to contract for 250 kilowatts or
more, per customer, of peak demand electricity. Requirements for registration on this limited basis
are as follows:
(A) The person shall provide the commission a signed, notarized affidavit indicating that it has a
written consent from each customer it wishes to serve, stating that the customer is satisfied that
the aggregator can provide aggregation services without establishing the cash and credit
resources prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(B) The person shall complete portions of the registration request form other than the information
prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subsection;
(C) A person registering on the basis of this paragraph is subject to the applicable post-registration
requirements of subsection (i) of this section.
(h) Registration procedures. The following procedures apply to all entities seeking to register pursuant to this
section:
(1) A registration request shall be made on the form approved by the commission, verified by oath or
affirmation, and signed by a registering party owner or partner, or an officer of the registering party.
The form may be obtained from the Central Records division of the commission or from the

commission’s Filing Clerk in accordance with the commission’s procedural rules, Chapter 22 of this
title, Subchapter E (relating to Pleadings and Other Documents).
(2) The registering party may identify certain information or documents submitted that it believes to
contain proprietary or confidential information. Registering parties may not designate the entire
registration request as confidential. Information designated as proprietary or confidential will be 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 6/28/00
treated in accordance with the standard protective order issued by the commission applicable to
requests to register as an aggregator. If and when a public information request is received for
information designated as confidential, the registering party has the burden of establishing that
information filed pursuant to this rule is proprietary or confidential.
(3) An application shall be processed as follows:
(A) The registering party shall immediately inform the commission of any material change in the
information provided in the registration request while the request is pending.
(B) The commission staff shall review the submitted form for completeness. Within 15 business
days of receipt of an incomplete request, the commission staff shall notify the registering party
in writing of the deficiencies in the request. The registering party shall have ten business days
from the issuance of the notification to cure the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not cured
within ten business days, the staff will notify the registering party that the registration request is
rejected without prejudice.
(C) Based upon the information provided pursuant to subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this section, the
commission shall determine whether a registering party is capable of fulfilling customer
protection provisions, disclosure requirements, and marketing guidelines of PURA.
(D) The commission shall determine whether to accept or reject the registration request within 60
days of the receipt of a complete application. Unacceptable registrations will be rejected without
prejudice to refiling.
(i) Post-registration requirements.
(1) An aggregator may not refuse to provide aggregation services or otherwise discriminate in the
provision of aggregation services to any customer because of race, creed, color, national origin,
ancestry, sex, marital status, source or level of income, disability, or familial status; or refuse to
provide aggregation services to a customer because the customer is located in an economically
distressed geographic area or qualifies for low-income affordability or energy efficiency services; or
otherwise unreasonably discriminate on the basis of the geographic location of a customer.
(2) An aggregator shall comply with the commission’s education, disclosure, and marketing guidelines
and rules, including those pertaining to customer protection and the filing of regular reports on
customer complaints. An aggregator may not release proprietary customer information to any person
unless the customer authorizes the release in a manner approved by the commission. An aggregator
shall disclose to customers, when a customer requests aggregation services, all of its trade or
commercial names, any agency relationships with REPs, and its sources of compensation for the
provision of aggregation services.
(3) An aggregator shall update any changes to business name, address, or phone number within ten
business days from the date of the change.

of this section.
(6) An aggregator shall file an annual report with the commission on September 1 of each year on a form

Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 6/28/00
(C) Financial obligations to customers shall be payable to them within 30 business days from the

the aggregator without the advance approval of the commission.
(E) The annual update required by paragraph (6) of this subsection shall include a sworn affidavit

methodology for that compliance.
(F) The aggregator shall maintain records on an ongoing basis of authorizations from the public
entities that have authorized it to provide aggregation services.
(8) A person that initially received its registration on the basis of not accepting payments for aggregation
services, and was therefore not subject to subsection (g) of this section, shall amend its registration
with a showing to the commission that it is able to comply with the requirements of subsection (g) of
this section in advance of accepting payments.
(9) Persons registered pursuant to the alternative requirements for limited registration specified in

context indicates otherwise:
(1) Broker -- A person that provides brokerage services.
(2) Brokerage services -- Providing advice or procurement services to, or acting on behalf of, a retail
electric customer regarding the selection of a REP, or a product or service offered by a REP.

Subchapter E. CERTIFICATION, LICENSING AND REGISTRATION
Effective 1/12/03
§25.113. Municipal Registration of Retail Electric Providers (REPs).
(a) Applicability. This section applies to municipalities that require retail electric providers (REPs) to register
in accordance with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.358 and to all REPs with a certificate
granted by the commission pursuant to PURA §39.352(a) and §25.107 of this title (relating to Certification
of Retail Electric Providers).
(b) Purpose. A municipality may require a REP to register as a condition of serving residents of the
municipality, in accordance with PURA §39.358. This section establishes an optional “safe-harbor” process
for municipal registration of REPs to standardize notice and filing procedures, deadlines, and registration
information and fees. The “safe-harbor” registration process simplifies and provides certainty to both
municipalities and REPs, thereby facilitating the development of a competitive retail electric market in Texas.
If a municipality enacts a registration ordinance that is consistent with this section, the ordinance shall be
deemed to comply with PURA §39.358. A municipality may exercise its authority under PURA §39.358
and adopt an ordinance that is not consistent with this section; however, such ordinance could be subject to
an appeal to the commission under PURA §32.001(b).
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
(1) Resident — Any electric customer located within the municipality, except the municipality itself,
regardless of customer class.
(2) Revocation — The cessation of all REP business operations within a municipality, pursuant to
municipal order.
(3) Suspension — The cessation of all REP business operations within a municipality associated with
obtaining new customers, pursuant to municipal order.
(d) Non-discrimination in REP registration requirements. A municipality shall not establish registration
requirements that are different for any REP or type of REP or that impose any disadvantage or confer any
preference on any REP or type of REP. However, a municipality may exclude from its registration
requirement a REP that provides service only to the municipality’s own electric accounts and not to any
residents of the municipality.
(e) Notice. A municipality that enacts an ordinance adopting the standard registration process under this section
shall file only the ordinance or section of ordinance, including the effective date, with the commission at least
30 days before the effective date of the ordinance. The filing shall not exceed ten pages. The filing of such
a municipality’s ordinance in accordance with §22.71 of this title (relating to Filing of Pleadings, Documents,
and Other Materials) shall serve as notice to all REPs of the requirement to submit a registration to the
municipality.
(f) Standards for registration of REPs. A municipality that adopts a “safe-harbor” ordinance in accordance
with this section shall process a REP’s registration request as follows:
(1) A REP shall register with a municipality that adopts an ordinance in accordance with this section
within 30 days after the ordinance requiring registration becomes effective or 30 days after providing
retail electric service to any resident of the municipality, whichever is later.
(2) A REP shall register with a municipality that adopts an ordinance in accordance with this section by
completing a form approved by the commission, and signed by an owner, partner, officer, or other
authorized representative of the registering REP. Forms may be submitted to a municipality by mail,
facsimile, or online where online registration is available. Registration forms may be obtained from
the commission’s Central Records division during normal business hours, or from the commission’s
website.

deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not cured within 20 business days, the municipality shall
immediately send a rejection notice to the registering REP that the registration is rejected without
prejudice. Absent such notification of rejection, the registration shall be deemed to have been
accepted.
(4) A municipality shall not deny a REP’s request for registration based upon investigations into the
fitness or capability of a REP that has a current certificate from the commission.
(5) A municipality shall not require a REP to undergo a hearing before the municipality for the purposes
of registration, nor require the REP to send a representative to the municipality for purposes of
processing the registration form.
(g) Information. A municipality may require a REP to provide only the information set forth below. A REP
shall provide all of the following information on the commission’s prescribed form to a municipality that has

(b) Back-billing and meter tampering charges.
(1) If any meter is found to be non-compliant with the accuracy standards required by §25.121(e) of
this title (relating to Meter Requirements), or if the TDU has provided incorrect consumption or
billing data to the REP, then consumption or billing data shall be corrected, and adjusted bills shall
be rendered. The TDU shall not back-bill for any period in which the current customer was not the
customer of record, or the current REP was not the REP of record. The TDU shall not assess any
meter tampering fees, meter repair charges, or restoration charges due to meter tampering, if the
current customer was not the customer of record when the meter tampering began, or if the current
REP was not the REP of record when the meter tampering began.
(2) Back-billing under this subsection shall not exceed a period of:
(A) three months, if the TDU discovers a non-compliant meter or other equipment that has not
been affected by meter tampering and the back-billing would result in additional electricity
charges to the customer; or
(B) six months, if the TDU discovers a non-compliant meter that has been affected by meter
tampering and the back-billing would result in additional charges or fees to the customer.
(3) The back-billing shall not be limited if the TDU discovers a non-compliant meter that has not been
affected by meter tampering or has provided incorrect meter readings that are unrelated to meter
tampering and the back-billing would result in a credit to the customer.
(4) In instances where the TDU finds it appropriate, the TDU may assess charges for services received
by the customer prior to the six months back-billed to the REP, and the charges assessed beyond six
months shall be sent to the end-use customer directly by the TDU. Charges assessed by the TDU
pursuant to this paragraph may extend to periods in which the current REP of record was not the
REP of record. Energy charges shall be determined using the ERCOT-wide bus average hub price
as calculated by the independent system operator for the applicable time periods. The utility shall
notify the current REP of record of the charges assessed to the customer beyond six months. The
TDU shall pay the current REP of record 50% of the energy charges collected for the period of time
in which that REP was the REP of record. The TDU shall provide the energy charges to the REP
pursuant to a method agreed to by the REP and the TDU.
(c) Calculation of charges. The charge for any period in which the meter was not in compliance with the
accuracy standard shall be based on an estimate using the standards for calculation as stated in the Tariff for
Retail Delivery Service, Section 4.8.1.4, adopted pursuant to §25.214 of this title (relating to Terms and
Conditions of Retail Delivery Service Provided by Investor Owned Transmission and Distribution Utilities).
(d) TDU responsibilities concerning metering accuracy. A TDU shall undertake all reasonable efforts to
minimize losses associated with inaccurate meters and meter tampering, including the prompt detection and
investigation of circumstances in which a meter is not accurately recording and reporting consumption. The

[TDU Letterhead]
Date: ________________
Address: ___________________________________
ESI-ID: ____________________________________
NOTICE OF METER TAMPERING
We have identified electric meter tampering, or theft of electric service at this location.
You may be billed for any applicable fees relating to repairing or replacing the electric
meter and other facilities, and for electricity usage not previously billed as a result of the
tampering or theft. A bill for these charges will be issued by your retail electric provider
(REP). If the meter tampering occurred prior to the time you became the customer of
record at this location, you may be billed for any of your electricity usage that was
previously unbilled. If the meter tampering began after you became customer of record at
this location and your current REP was providing your electric service at that time, you
may also be billed meter repair and restoration charges. Your REP may also authorize
disconnection of service for nonpayment. You will not be able to switch your service to
another REP until you have satisfied your obligation to pay these charges.
(f) Burden of Proof. If a retail customer challenges the TDU’s determination of meter tampering, or the
imposition of charges based on any such determination, in a contested case proceeding before the
commission, the TDU shall bear the burden of proof that meter tampering occurred.
(g) Switch-hold and disconnection of service. Upon determination by the TDU that tampering has occurred at
a premises, the TDU shall on the same day place a switch-hold on the ESI ID, which shall prevent a switch
or move-in transaction from being completed for the ESI ID. If the REP exercises its right to disconnect
service for non-payment pursuant to §25.483 of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service), the switchhold shall continue to remain in place. The switch-hold shall remain in effect until the REP of record notifies
the TDU to remove the switch-hold because the customer has satisfied its payment obligations for backbillings and meter repair charges due to tampering, or until such time as removal of the switch-hold is
otherwise authorized by this section. The TDU shall create and maintain a secure list of ESI IDs with switchholds that REPs may access. The list shall not include any customer information other than the ESI ID and
date the switch-hold was placed. The list shall be updated daily, and made available through a secure means
by the TDU. The TDU may provide this list in a secure format through the web portal developed as part of
its AMS deployment.
(1) The REP via a standard market process shall submit a request to remove the switch-hold once
satisfactory payment is received from the retail customer for the back-billings and meter repair and
restoration charges.
(2) For a customer receiving service under §25.498 of this title (relating to Retail Electric Service Using
a Customer Prepayment Device or System), a TDU shall disconnect service within one day of its
receipt of the REP’s request for disconnection if the TDU has determined that tampering with the
customer’s meter has occurred.

Subchapter F. METERING
Effective 7/1/10
(3) At the time of a mass transition, the TDU shall remove the switch-hold for any ESI ID that is
transitioned to a provider of last resort (POLR). No later than the business day following the
completion of the last mass transition switch, the TDU shall provide all POLR providers a list of
ESI IDs previously subject to a switch-hold.
(4) When the REP of record issues a move-out request for an ESI ID under a switch-hold, the REP of
record’s relationship with the ESI ID is terminated and the switch-hold shall be removed.
(h) Move-ins with a valid switch-hold.
(1) If a retail applicant for electric service selects a REP and the selected REP submits a move-in
transaction for an ESI ID that has an existing switch-hold as defined in subsection (g) of this section
due to meter tampering, the TDU shall notify the selected REP that the move-in transaction is
rejected via a standard market process. If the selected REP determines the applicant’s premise has
an existing switch-hold, the selected REP may request removal of the switch-hold prior to
submitting a move-in transaction.
(2) The selected REP shall use best efforts to promptly determine whether the applicant for electric
service is a new occupant not associated with the customer for which the switch-hold was imposed
and, if so, obtain adequate documentation that the move-in request is legitimate. Adequate
documentation shall include a copy of a signed lease, an affidavit of a landlord, closing documents,
a certificate of occupancy, a utility bill dated within the past two months from a different premise,
or other comparable documentation in the name of the retail applicant for electric service, and shall
include a signed statement from the applicant stating that the applicant is a new occupant of the
premises and is not associated with the preceding occupant.
(3) Upon receipt of such information from the applicant, the selected REP shall ensure that the
applicant’s financial information, driver’s license number, and social security number and federal
tax ID number are protected from improper release. Another REP or a TDU that receives such
information from the selected REP shall also protect such information from release.
(4) The selected REP shall initiate the use of ERCOT’s MarkeTrak issue process to request removal of
the switch-hold and provide the supporting documentation to the TDU. This request and supporting
documentation shall be subsequently provided to the current REP of record through the MarkeTrak
process.
(5) The current REP of record may submit other information in response to the supporting
documentation submitted by the selected REP, using the MarkeTrak process. This additional
information shall be made available to the TDU and the selected REP through the MarkeTrak
process. Within four business hours of receiving the request to remove the switch-hold and
supporting documentation, the TDU shall determine whether the switch-hold should be removed by
confirming the documentation provided under subsection (h)(2) of this section is adequate. In
making this decision, the TDU shall take into consideration any additional information submitted
by the current REP of record. If the TDU determines the documentation is inadequate, the selected
REP and the current REP of record shall be immediately notified through the MarkeTrak process
that the request to remove the switch-hold is rejected, and the switch-hold shall remain in effect
pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. If the TDU concludes that the documentation is adequate,
it shall immediately grant the request to remove the switch-hold and both the selected REP and
current REP record shall be immediately notified of the removal through the MarkeTrak process.
After being notified of the removal of the switch-hold, the selected REP shall resubmit the move-in
transaction to initiate the move-in request.
(6) A TX SET transaction or process developed specifically for the purpose of addressing the treatment
of switch-holds in the context of move-in transactions shall be used as a substitute for the equivalent
process described in this subsection once that TX SET transaction becomes available. The Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) shall develop this TX SET transaction process as soon as
possible.
(7) For a move-in transaction indicating that the ESI ID is subject to a continuous service agreement,
the TDU shall remove any switch-hold on that ESI ID and complete the move-in.

features in the deployment plan approved by the commission.
(5) Web portal --The website made available on the internet in compliance with this section by an
electric utility or a group of electric utilities through which secure, read-only access to AMS usage
data is made available to the customer, the customer’s REP of record, and entities authorized by the
customer.
(d) Deployment and use of advanced meters.
(1) Deployment and use of an AMS by an electric utility is voluntary unless otherwise ordered by the
commission. However, deployment and use of an AMS for which an electric utility seeks a
surcharge for cost recovery must be consistent with this section, except to the extent that the electric
utility has obtained a waiver from the commission.
(2) Six months prior to initiating deployment of an AMS or as soon as practicable after the effective
date of this section, whichever is later, an electric utility that intends to deploy an AMS must file a
statement of AMS functionality, and either a notice of deployment or a request for approval of
deployment. An electric utility may request a surcharge under subsection (k) of this section in
combination with a notice of deployment or a request for approval of deployment, or separately. A
proceeding that includes a request to establish or amend a surcharge will be a ratemaking proceeding
and a proceeding involving only a request for approval of deployment will not be a ratemaking
proceeding.
(3) The statement of AMS functionality must:
(A) state whether the AMS meets the requirements specified in subsection (g) of this section
and what additional features, if any, it will have;
(B) describe any variances between technologies and meter functions within the electric
utility’s service territory; and

(6) Competitively sensitive information contained in the deployment plan and the monthly progress
reports required under paragraph (9) of this subsection may be filed confidentially. An electric
utility’s deployment plan must be maintained and made available for review on the electric utility’s
website. Competitively sensitive information contained in the deployment plan must be maintained
and made available at the electric utility’s offices in Austin. Any REP that wishes to review
competitively sensitive information contained in the electric utility’s deployment plan available at
its Austin office may do so during normal business hours upon reasonable advanced notice to the
electric utility and after executing a non-disclosure agreement with the electric utility.
(7) If the request for approval of a deployment plan contains the information described in paragraph (4)
of this subsection and the AMS features described in subsection (g)(1) of this section, then the
commission will approve or disapprove the deployment plan within 150 days, but this deadline may
be extended by the commission for good cause.
(8) An electric utility’s treatment of AMS, including technology, functionalities, services, deployment,
operations, maintenance, and cost recovery must not be unreasonably discriminatory, prejudicial,
preferential, or anticompetitive.
(9) Each electric utility must provide progress reports on a monthly basis following the filing of its
deployment plan with the commission until deployment is complete. Upon filing of such reports,
an electric utility operating in an area open to customer choice must notify all REPs of the filing

conducting its normal operations and maintenance with respect to the electric utility’s transmission
and distribution system and metering systems.
(11) During and following deployment, any outage related to normal operations and maintenance that
affects a REP’s ability to obtain information from the system must be communicated to the REP
through the outage and restoration notice process according to Applicable Legal Authorities, as
defined in §25.214(d)(1) of this title (relating to Tariff for Retail Delivery Service). Notification of
any planned or unplanned outage that affects access to customer usage data must be posted on the
electric utility’s web portal home page.
(12) An electric utility subject to §25.343 of this title (relating to Competitive Energy Services) must not
provide any advanced metering equipment or service that is deemed a competitive energy service
under that section. Any functionality of the AMS that is a required feature under this section or that
is included in an approved deployment plan or otherwise approved by the commission does not
constitute a competitive energy service under §25.343 of this title.
(13) An electric utility’s deployment and provision of AMS services and features, including but not
limited to the features required in subsection (g) of this section, are subject to the limitation of
liability provisions found in the electric utility’s tariff.
(e) Technology requirements. Except for pilot programs, an electric utility must not deploy AMS technology

(B) two-way communications between the meter and the electric utility;
(C) remote disconnection and reconnection capability for meters rated at or below 200 amps.
(D) time-stamped meter data;
(E) access to customer usage data by the customer, the customer’s REP of record, and entities
authorized by the customer provided that 15-minute interval or shorter data from the
electric utility’s AMS must be transmitted to the electric utility’s or a group of electric
utilities’ web portal on a day-after basis;
(F) capability to provide on-demand reads of a customer’s advanced meter through the
graphical user interface of an electric utility’s or a group of electric utilities’ web portal
when requested by a customer, the customer’s REP of record, or entities authorized by the
customer subject to network traffic such as interval data collection, market orders if
applicable, and planned and unplanned outages;
(G) for an electric utility that provides access through an application programming interface,
the capability to provide on-demand reads of a customer’s advanced meter data, subject to
network traffic such as interval data collection, market orders if applicable, and planned

such as ZigBee, Home-Plug, or the equivalent through the electric utility’s AMS. This
requirement applies only to a HAN device paired to a meter and in use at the time that the
version of the web portal approved in Docket Number 47472 was implemented and
terminates when the HAN device is disconnected at the request of the customer or a moveout transaction occurs for the customer’s premises; and
(K) the ability to upgrade these features as the need arises.
(2) A waiver from any of the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection may be granted by the
commission if it would be uneconomic or technically infeasible to implement or there is an adequate
substitute for that particular requirement. The electric utility must meet its burden of proof in its
waiver request.
(3) In areas where there is not a commission-approved independent regional transmission organization,
standards referred to in this section for time tolerance and data transfer and security may be approved
by a regional transmission organization approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
or, if there is no approved regional transmission organization, by the commission.
(4) Once an electric utility has deployed its advanced meters, it may add or enhance features provided
by AMS, as technology evolves. The electric utility must notify the commission and REPs of any
such additions or enhancements at least three months in advance of deployment, with a description
of the features, the deployment and notification plan, and the cost of such additions or
enhancements, and must follow the monthly progress report process described in subsection (d)(9)
of this section until the enhancement process is complete.
(h) Discretionary Meter Services. An electric utility that operates in an area that offers customer choice must
offer, as discretionary services in its tariff, installation of enhanced advanced meters and advanced meter
features.
(1) A REP may request the electric utility to provide enhanced advanced meters, additional metering
technology, or advanced meter features not specifically offered in the electric utility’s tariff, that are
technically feasible, generally available in the market, and compatible with the electric utility’s
AMS.

system changes required by the electric utility to offer those meters or features.
(3) Upon request by a REP, an electric utility must expeditiously provide a report to the REP that includes
an evaluation of the cost and a schedule for providing the enhanced advanced meters or advanced
meter features of interest to the REP. The REP must pay a reasonable discretionary services fee for
this report. This discretionary services fee must be included in the electric utility’s tariff.
(4) If an electric utility deploys enhanced advanced meters or advanced meter features not addressed in
its tariff at the request of the REP, the electric utility must expeditiously apply to amend its tariff to
specifically include the enhanced advanced meters or meter features that it agreed to deploy.
Additional REPs may request the tariffed enhanced advanced meters or advanced meter features
under the process described in this paragraph of this subsection.
(i) Tariff. All discretionary AMS features offered by the electric utility must be described in the electric utility’s
tariff.
(j) Access to meter data.
(1) A customer may authorize its meter data to be available to an entity other than its REP. An electric
utility must provide a customer, the customer’s REP of record, and other entities authorized by the 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS

calculate charges for service, historical load data, and any other proprietary customer information.
The access must be convenient and secure, and the data must be made available no later than the
day after it was created.
(2) The requirement to provide access to the data begins when the electric utility has installed 2,000
advanced meters for residential and non-residential customers. If an electric utility has already
installed 2,000 advanced meters by the effective date of this section, the electric utility must provide
access to the data in the timeframe approved by the commission in either the deployment plan or
request for surcharge proceeding. If only a notice of deployment has been filed, access to the data
must begin no later than six months from the filing of the notice of deployment with the commission.
(3) An electric utility’s or group of electric utilities’ web portal must use appropriate and reasonable
standards and methods to provide secure access for the customer, the customer’s REP of record, and
entities authorized by the customer to the meter data. The electric utility must have an independent
security audit conducted within one year of providing that access to meter data. The electric utility
must promptly report the audit results to the commission.
(4) The independent organization, regional transmission organization, or regional reliability entity must
have access to information that is required for wholesale settlement, load profiling, load research,
and reliability purposes.
(k) Cost recovery for deployment of AMS.
(1) Recovery Method. The commission will establish a nonbypassable surcharge for an electric utility
to recover reasonable and necessary costs incurred in deploying AMS to residential customers and
nonresidential customers other than those required by the independent system operator to have an
interval data recorder meter. The surcharge must not be established until after a detailed deployment
plan is filed under subsection (d) of this section. In addition, the surcharge must not ultimately
recover more than the AMS costs that are spent, reasonable and necessary, and fully allocated, but
may include estimated costs that will be reconciled pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection. As
indicated by the definition of AMS in subsection (c)(2) of this section, the costs for facilities that do
not perform the functions and have the features specified in this section must not be included in the
surcharge provided for by this subsection unless an electric utility has received a waiver under
subsection (g)(2) of this section. The costs of providing AMS services include those costs of AMS
installed as part of a pilot program under this section. Costs of providing AMS for a particular
customer class must be surcharged only to customers in that customer class.
(2) Carrying Costs. The annualized carrying-cost rate to be applied to the unamortized balance of the
AMS capital costs must be the electric utility’s authorized weighted-average cost of capital
(WACC). If the commission has not approved a WACC for the electric utility within the last four
years, the commission may set a new WACC to apply to the unamortized balance of the AMS capital
costs. In each subsequent rate proceeding in which the commission resets the electric utility’s
WACC, the carrying-charge rate that is applied to the unamortized balance of the utility’s AMS
costs must be correspondingly adjusted to reflect the new authorized WACC.
(3) Surcharge Proceeding. In the request for surcharge proceeding, the commission will set the
surcharge based on a levelized amount, and an amortization period based on the useful life of the
AMS. The commission may set the surcharge to reflect a deployment of advanced meters that is up
to one-third of the electric utility’s total meters over each calendar year, regardless of the rate of
actual AMS deployment. The actual or expected net operating cost savings from AMS deployment,
to the extent that the operating costs are not reflected in base rates, may be considered in setting the
surcharge. If an electric utility that requests a surcharge does not have an approved deployment
plan, the commission in the surcharge proceeding may reconcile the costs that the electric utility
already spent on AMS in accordance with paragraph (6) of this subsection and may approve a
deployment plan.
(4) General Base Rate Proceeding while Surcharge is in Effect. If the commission conducts a
general base rate proceeding while a surcharge under this section is in effect, then the commission 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter F. METERING
Effective 5/11/20
(P 48525)
will include the reasonable and necessary costs of installed AMS equipment in the base rates and
decrease the surcharge accordingly, and permit reasonable recovery of any non-AMS metering
equipment that has not yet been fully depreciated but has been replaced by the equipment installed
under an approved deployment plan.
(5) Annual Reports. An electric utility must file annual reports with the commission updating the cost
information used in setting the surcharge. The annual reports must include the actual costs spent to
date in the deployment of AMS and the actual net operating cost savings from AMS deployment
and how those numbers compare to the projections used to set the surcharge. During the annual
report process, an electric utility may apply to update its surcharge, and the commission may set a
schedule for such applications. For a levelized surcharge, the commission may alter the length of
the surcharge collection period based on review of information concerning changes in deployment
costs or operating costs savings in the annual report or changes in WACC. An annual report filed
with the commission will not be a ratemaking proceeding, but an application by the electric utility
to update the surcharge must be a ratemaking proceeding.
(6) Reconciliation Proceeding. All costs recovered through the surcharge must be reviewed in a
reconciliation proceeding on a schedule to be determined by the commission. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the electric utility may request multiple reconciliation proceedings, but no more
frequently than once every three years. There is a presumption that costs spent in accordance with
a deployment plan or amended deployment plan approved by the commission are reasonable and
necessary. Any costs recovered through the surcharge that are found in a reconciliation proceeding
not to have been spent or properly allocated, or not to be reasonable and necessary, must be refunded
to electric utility’s customers. In addition, the commission will make a final determination of the
net operating cost savings from AMS deployment used to reduce the amount of costs that ultimately
can be recovered through the surcharge. Accrual of interest on any refunded or surcharged amounts
resulting from the reconciliation must be at the electric utility’s WACC and must begin at the time
the under or over recovery occurred.
(7) Cross-subsidization and fees. The electric utility must account for its costs in a manner that
ensures there is no inappropriate cost allocation, cost recovery, or cost assignment that would cause
cross-subsidization between utility activities and non-utility activities. The electric utility shall not
charge a disconnection or reconnection fee that was approved by the commission prior to the
effective date of this rule, for a disconnection or reconnection that is effectuated using the remote
disconnection or connection capability of an advanced meter.

(a) Purpose. This section allocates responsibilities for obtaining load research information necessary to support
the load profiling activities of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), provides for access to that
load profile research data by retail electric providers (REPs), and provides a method for recovery of costs by
a person who successfully requests a new load profile.
(b) Applicability. This section applies to ERCOT, each transmission and distribution utility (TDU) that has a
service territory within ERCOT, and each REP certified by the commission. For the purposes of this section,
the term person may include a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative.
(c) Load research responsibility. Each TDU shall perform load research to support ERCOT’s load profiling
activities, as directed by ERCOT.
(1) ERCOT shall be responsible for load research sample design and sample point selection for
ERCOT-directed load profiling and load research samples. ERCOT shall coordinate with each TDU
to optimize load research programs of both ERCOT and the TDU. The same samples shall be used
to support both the TDU’s load research activities and ERCOT’s load profile research needs
whenever reasonably possible. Each TDU shall coordinate with ERCOT to synchronize its load
research cycles and sample replacement with those of ERCOT.
(2) ERCOT, in consultation with TDUs, shall specify the manner of data collection for ERCOT load
profile research samples and the means and frequency of transmission of such information to
ERCOT. Each TDU shall adhere to the specifications for data collection and transmission specified
by ERCOT.
(3) A TDU may recover its reasonable and necessary costs incurred in performing load profile research
as required by this section.
(4) This section shall not be interpreted to require a TDU to redeploy any existing samples that were
deployed less than five years before the effective date of this section, although this section shall also
not be interpreted as addressing the appropriateness of continued deployment of existing TDU
samples apart from an ERCOT request to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the TDU shall
deploy additional samples as requested by ERCOT in order to support ERCOT’s load profiling
activities.
(d) Availability of load research data. ERCOT shall make load profile research data collected under its
direction for accepted load profiles available to all certified REPs.
(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a municipally-owned utility or electric cooperative that conducts
load research activities shall have access to load research data maintained by ERCOT only if it
shares statistically valid load research data from its own service territory with ERCOT in accordance
with the provisions of subparagraphs (A)-(C) of this paragraph.
(A) A municipally-owned electric utility or electric cooperative may submit load research data
only if it is obtained in a manner consistent with the Association of Edison Illuminating
Companies (AEIC) load research standards and provided in the form and manner specified
by ERCOT pursuant to subsection (c)(2) of this section.
(B) The municipally-owned electric utility or electric cooperative shall provide to ERCOT
information concerning its load research sample design and any other relevant information
required by ERCOT.
(C) ERCOT shall determine whether the load research data submitted by a municipally owned
utility or electric cooperative is statistically valid sample data compiled in a manner
consistent with the AEIC Load Profiling Guidelines.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter F. METERING
Effective 4/16/03
(2) ERCOT shall make available customer level data collected under its direction for accepted load
profiles for all customers as provided in this subsection, unless ERCOT concludes that due to the
size, usage characteristics, or location of a sample, or other factors, there is a significant risk that
release of customer level data for a sample would lead to the disclosure of the identity of the
customer being sampled. ERCOT shall make available, as provided in this subsection, all other load
profile research data on an aggregated basis, unless ERCOT determines that there is significant risk
that disclosure of such aggregated data would lead to the disclosure of the identity of one or more
sampled customers. In no event shall the location, name, account number, zip code, or electric
service identifier (ESI-ID) of an individual customer in a load profile research sample be made
available. The following information shall be made available for load profile research data provided
on either an individualized or aggregated basis:
(A) customer class;
(B) TDU service area;
(C) weather zone; and
(D) interval usage, or average interval usage for aggregated data.
(3) ERCOT may not assess a charge to access the data specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(e) New load profiles and fee for use of load profiles. ERCOT may establish new load profiles at the request
of a REP or another person.
(1) A request for a new or modified load profile must include the requested information detailed in
ERCOT’s Load Profiling Guide.
(2) Any costs associated with developing the supporting data and documentation that is necessary for
ERCOT’s evaluation of the proposed profile change shall be the responsibility of the person initially
requesting the profile change.
(3) Within six months of the effective date of this section, ERCOT shall establish and implement a
process to collect a fee from any REP who seeks to assign customers to a non-ERCOT sponsored
profile. The process shall include a method for other REPs who use the profile to compensate the
original requester of the new profile and for ERCOT to notify TDUs which REPs are authorized to
use the new profile. A TDU shall not, without authorization, assign a customer to a profile for which
a REP or another person has paid the costs of developing the new profile.

Effective 5/11/20
(P 48525)
(v) The customer may be required by the customer’s REP of record to choose a
different product or service before initiation of the non-standard metering
service, subject to any applicable charges or fees required under the customer’s
existing contract, if the customer is currently enrolled in a product or service that
relies on an advanced meter; and
(vi) For a customer that does not currently have an advanced meter, the date (60
days after service of the notice) by which the customer must provide a signed,
written acknowledgement and payment of the one-time fee to the electric utility
prescribed by subsection (f)(3) of this section. If the signed, written
acknowledgement and payment are not received within 60 days, the electric
utility will install an advanced meter on the customer’s premises.
(D) The electric utility must retain the signed, written acknowledgement for at least two years
after the non-standard meter is removed from the premises. The commission may adopt a
form for the written acknowledgement.
(E) An electric utility must offer non-standard metering through the following means:
(i) disabling communications technology in an advanced meter if feasible;
(ii) if applicable, allowing the customer to continue to receive metering service
using the existing meter if the electric utility determines that it meets applicable

(iv) a digital, non-communicating meter.
(F) The electric utility must not initiate the process to provide non-standard metering service
before it has received the customer’s payment and signed, written acknowledgement.
The electric utility must initiate the approved standard market process to notify the
customer’s REP of record within three days of the electric utility’s receipt of the
customer’s payment and signed, written acknowledgement. Within 30 days of receipt of
the payment of the one-time fee and the signed written acknowledgement from the
customer, the electric utility, using the approved standard market process, must notify the
customer’s REP of record of the date the non-standard metering service was initiated.
(2) Termination of non-standard metering service. A customer receiving non-standard metering
service may terminate that service by notifying the customer’s electric utility. The customer will
remain responsible for all costs related to non-standard metering service.
(e) Other electric utility obligations.
(1) When an electric utility completes a move-out transaction for a customer who was receiving nonstandard metering service, the electric utility must install or activate an advanced meter at the
premises.
(2) An electric utility must read a non-standard meter monthly. In order for the electric utility to
maintain a non-standard meter at the customer’s premises, the customer must provide the electric
utility with sufficient access to properly operate and maintain the meter, including reading and
testing the meter.
(f) Cost recovery and compliance tariffs. All costs incurred by an electric utility to implement this section
must be borne only by customers who choose non-standard metering service. A customer receiving nonstandard metering service must be charged a one-time fee and a recurring monthly fee.
(1) An electric utility’s application for approval of its non-standard metering service tariff or amended
tariff must be fully supported with testimony and documentation. The application must include
one-time fees and a monthly fee for non-standard metering service and must also include the fees
for other discretionary services performed by the electric utility that are affected by the customer’s
selection of non-standard metering service. The commission will allow the electric utility to
recover the reasonable rate case expenses that it incurs under this paragraph as part of the one-time 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter F. METERING
Effective 5/11/20
(P 48525)
fee, the monthly fee, or both. The application must describe the extent to which the back-office
costs that are new and fixed vary depending on the number of customers receiving non-standard
metering service. Unless otherwise ordered, the electric utility must serve notice of the approved
rates and the effective date of the approved rates within five working days of the filing of the
commission’s final order to REPs that are authorized by the registration agent to provide service in
the electric utility’s service area. Notice to REPs under this paragraph may be served by email and
must be served at least 45 days before the effective date of the rates.
(2) An electric utility must have a single recurring monthly fee for non-standard metering service and
several one-time fees, one of which must apply to the customer depending on the customer’s
circumstances. A one-time fee must be charged to a customer that does not have an advanced
meter at the customer’s premises and will continue receiving metering service through the meter
currently at the premises. For a customer that currently has an advanced meter at the premises, the
fee will vary depending on the type of meter that is installed to provide non-standard metering
service, and the fee must include the cost to remove the advanced meter and subsequently reinstall an advanced meter once non-standard metering service is terminated. The one-time fee
must recover costs to initiate non-standard metering service. The monthly fee must recover
ongoing costs to provide non-standard metering service, including costs for meter reading and
billing. Fixed costs not related to the initiation of non-standard metering service may be allocated
between the one-time and monthly fees and recovered through the monthly fee over a shortened
period of time.
(g) Retail electric product compatibility. After receipt of the notice prescribed by subsection (d)(1)(C) of
this section, if the customer’s current product is not compatible with non-standard metering service, the
customer’s REP of record must work with the customer to either promptly transition the customer to a
product that is compatible with non-standard metering service or transfer the customer to another REP,
subject to any applicable charges or fees required under the customer’s existing contract. If the customer is
unresponsive, the customer’s REP of record may transition the customer without the customer’s affirmative
consent to a market-based, month-to-month product that is compatible with non-standard metering service.
Alternatively, if the customer is unresponsive, the customer’s REP of record may transfer the customer to
another REP under §25.493 (relating to Acquisition and Transfer of Customers from One Retail Electric
Provider or Another) so long as the new REP serves the customer using a market-based, month-to-month
product with a rate (excluding charges for non-standard metering service or other discretionary services) no
higher than one of the tests prescribed by §25.498(c)(15)(A)-(C) of this title (relating to Prepaid Service).
The customer’s REP of record must promptly provide the customer notice that the customer has been
transferred to a new product and, if applicable, to a new REP, and must also promptly provide the new
Terms of Service and Electricity Facts Label.

(7) Utility -- A public, private, or member-owned utility furnishing electricity service to an apartment
house served by a master meter.
(c) Records and reports.
(1) The apartment house owner shall maintain and make available for inspection by the tenant during
normal business hours:
(A) the billing from the utility to the apartment house owner for the current month and the 12
preceding months; and
(B) the calculation of the average cost per kilowatt-hour for the current month and the 12
preceding months which was used in assessing tenant utility billings. The average cost per
kilowatt-hour shall be equal to the charges for the electric service plus applicable tax, less
any penalties charged by the utility or retail electric provider to the apartment house owner
for disconnect, and reconnect, late payment or other similar service charges, divided by the
total number of billing units.
(2) All records shall be made available to the commission upon request.
(3) Records shall be made available at the resident manager’s office during reasonable business hours
or, if there is no resident manager, at the dwelling unit of the tenant at the convenience of both the
apartment house owner and the tenant.
(d) Calculation of costs. Central system utilities costs shall be calculated based on metered kilowatt-hour of the
central system during the same billing period as that of the utility. The metered kilowatt-hour of the central
system shall be multiplied by the average cost per billing calculated according to all applicable industry
standards. The cost of nonsubmetered master metered utilities shall be the total charges for electric service
to the apartment house less any penalties charged by the utility or the retail electric provider to the apartment
house owner for disconnect, reconnect, late payment or other similar service charges.
(e) Billing. All rental agreements between the apartment house owner and the tenants shall provide a clear
written description of the method of the allocation of central system utilities or non-submetered master
metered utilities for the apartment house. The method of allocation may be changed only after 90 days notice
of the change to the tenants. The rental agreement for each apartment unit shall contain a statement of the
average monthly bill for the previous calendar year for that apartment unit. If there is no rental agreement,
apartment house owners shall provide the method of allocation in a separate written document.
(1) Rendering and form of bill.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter G. SUBMETERING
Effective 1/6/11
(A) Bills shall be rendered for the same billing period as that of the utility or retail electric
provider, generally monthly, unless service is rendered for less than that period.
(B) The allocation of central system utilities costs or nonsubmetered master metered utilities
costs to tenants shall be based on one or a combination of the following methods.
(i) the total square footage living area of the dwelling unit as a percentage of the total
square footage living area of all dwelling units of the apartment house and all
heated and/or air-conditioned common areas. This percentage shall be stated in
the rental agreement for each dwelling unit; and
(ii) the individually metered or submetered utility usage of the dwelling unit as a
percentage of the sum of the individually metered or submetered usage of all
dwelling units.
(C) Methods to allocate central system utility costs or nonsubmetered master metered utilities
to tenants, other than the method outlined in this section, must be approved by the
commission.
(D) Billings to the tenant shall not be included as part of the rental payment or as part of
billings for any other service to the tenant. A separate billing must be issued or, if issued
on a multi-item bill, utility billing information must be separate and distinct from any other
charges on the bill. The bill may not include a deposit, late penalty, reconnect charge, or
any other charges unless otherwise provided for by this chapter. A one-time penalty not to
exceed 5.0% may be made on delinquent accounts. If such penalty is applied, the bill shall
indicate the amount due if paid by the due date and the amount due if the late penalty is
incurred. No late penalty may be applied unless agreed to by the tenant in a written lease
which states the exact dollar or percentage amount of such late penalty.
(E) An apartment house owner may not impose additional charges on a tenant in excess of the
actual charges imposed on the apartment house owner for utility consumption by the
apartment house.
(2) Due date. The due date of the bill shall not be less than seven days after issuance. A bill for service
is delinquent if not received by the party indicated on the bill by the due date. The postmark date,
if any, on the envelope of the bill or on the bill itself shall constitute proof of the date of issuance.
An issuance date on the bill shall constitute proof of the date of issuance if there is no postmark on
the envelope or bill. If the due date falls on a holiday or weekend, the due date for payment purposes
shall be the next workday after the due date.
(3) Overbilling and underbilling. If billings are found to be in error, the apartment house owner shall
calculate a billing adjustment. If the tenant is due a refund, an adjustment shall be made for the
entire period of the overcharges. If the tenant was undercharged, the apartment house owner may
backbill the tenant for the amount which was underbilled. The backbilling is not to exceed six
months unless the apartment house owner can produce records to identify and justify the additional
amount of backbilling. If the underbilling is $25 or more, the apartment house owner shall offer to
such tenant a deferred payment plan option, for the same length of time as that of the underbilling.
Furthermore, adjustments for usage by a previous tenant may not be backbilled to the current tenant.
(4) Discontinuance of electric service. Disconnection of a dwelling unit by the apartment house owner
is governed by Texas Property Code §92.008(b). Disconnection of electric service by a retail
electric provider is governed by §25.483(k) of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service).
Disconnection of service by an electric utility that is not a transmission and distributed utility is
governed by §25.29(j) of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service).
(5) Disputed bills and complaints. In the event of a dispute between the tenant and the apartment
house owner regarding any bill, the apartment house owner shall immediately make such
investigation as shall be required by the particular case, and report the results thereof to the tenant.
The investigation and report shall be completed within 30 days from the date the tenant notified the
apartment house owner of the dispute. If the tenant is dissatisfied with the results of the
investigation, the apartment house owner shall inform the tenant of the Public Utility Commission

(D) all submeter test results for the current month and the 12 preceding months.
(2) Records shall be made available at the resident manager’s office during reasonable business hours
or, if there is no resident manager, at the dwelling unit of the tenant at the convenience of both the
apartment owner and tenant.
(3) All records shall be made available to the commission upon request.
(d) Billing. All rental agreements between the owner and the tenants shall clearly state that the dwelling unit is
submetered, that the bills will be issued thereon, that electrical consumption charges for all common areas
and common facilities will be the responsibility of the owner and not of the tenant, and that any disputes
relating to the computation of the tenant’s bill and the accuracy of the submetering device will be between
the tenant and the owner. Each owner shall provide a tenant, at the time the lease is signed, a copy of this
section or a narrative summary as approved by the commission to assure that the tenant is informed of his
rights and the owner’s responsibilities under this section.
(1) Rendering and form of bill.
(A) Bills shall be rendered for the same billing period as that of the electric utility, generally
monthly, unless service is rendered for less than that period. Bills shall be rendered as
promptly as possible following the reading of the submeters. The submeters shall be read
within three days of the scheduled reading date of the electric utility’s master meter.
(B) The billing unit shall be that used by the electric utility in its billing to the owner.
(C) The owner shall be responsible for determining that the energy billed to any dwelling unit
shall be only for that submetered and consumed within that unit.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter G. SUBMETERING
Effective 6/10/13
(D) Submetered billings shall not be included as part of the rental payment or as part of billings
for any other service to the tenant. A separate billing must be issued or, if issued on a
multi-item bill, submetered billing information must be separate and distinct from any other
charges on the bill and conform to information required in subparagraph (H) of this
paragraph. The submetered bill must clearly state “submetered electricity.”
(E) The bill shall reflect only submetered usage. Utility consumption at all common facilities
will be the responsibility of the owner and not of the tenant. Allocation of central systems
for air conditioning, heating and hot water is not prohibited by this section as set forth in
§25.141 of this title (relating to Central System or Nonsubmetered Master Metered
Utilities).
(F) The owner shall not impose any extra charges on the tenant over and above those charges
which are billed by the retail electric provider or utility to the owner. The bill may not
include a deposit, late penalty, reconnect charge, or any other charges unless otherwise
provided for by these sections.
(i) A one-time penalty not to exceed 5.0% may be made on delinquent accounts. If
the penalty is applied, the bill shall indicate the amount due if paid by the due date
and the amount due if the late penalty is incurred. No late penalty may be applied
unless agreed to by the tenant in a written lease which states the exact dollar or
percentage amount of the late penalty.
(ii) In a mobile home park a reconnect fee may be applied for a mobile home not
leased by the mobile home park owner if service to the pad site tenant is
disconnected for non-payment of submetered bills in accordance with subsection
(e)(1) of this section. Such reconnect fee shall be calculated based on the average
actual cost to the owner for the expenses associated with the reconnection, but
under no circumstances shall exceed $10. No reconnect charge may be applied
unless agreed to by the tenant in a written lease which states the exact dollar
amount of such reconnect charge.
(G) The tenant’s submeter bills shall be calculated in the following manner: after the electric
bill is received from the utility or retail electric provider, the owner shall divide the net
total charges for electrical consumption, plus applicable tax, by the total number of
kilowatt-hours to obtain an average cost per kilowatt-hour. The average kilowatt-hour cost
shall then be multiplied by each tenant’s kilowatt-hour consumption to obtain the charge
to the tenant. The computation of the average cost per kilowatt-hour shall not include any
penalties charged by the utility or the retail electric provider to the owner for disconnect,
reconnect, late payment, or other similar service charges.
(H) The tenant’s electric submeter bill shall show all of the following information:
(i) the date and reading of the submeter at the beginning and at the end of the period
for which the bill is rendered;
(ii) the number of billing units metered;
(iii) the computed rate per billing unit;
(iv) the total amount due for electricity used;
(v) a clear and unambiguous statement that the bill is not from the utility or retail
electric provider, which shall be named in the statement;
(vi) the name and address of the tenant to whom the bill is applicable;
(vii) the name of the firm rendering the submetering bill and the name or title, address,
and telephone number of the person or persons to be contacted in case of a billing
dispute;
(viii) the date by which the tenant must pay the bill; and
(ix) the name, address, and telephone number of the party to whom payment is to be
made.
(2) Due date. The due date of the bill shall not be less than seven days after issuance. A bill for
submetered service is delinquent if not received by the party indicated on the bill by the due date. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter G. SUBMETERING
Effective 6/10/13
The postmark date, if any, on the envelope of the bill or on the bill itself shall constitute proof of the
date of issuance. An issuance date on the bill shall constitute proof of the date of issuance if there
is no postmark on the envelope or bill. If the due date falls on a holiday or weekend, the due date
for payment purposes shall be the next work day after the due date.
(3) Disputed bills. In the event of a dispute between the tenant and the owner regarding any bill, the
owner shall promptly make an investigation as shall be required by the particular case, and report
the results to the tenant. The investigation and report shall be completed within 30 days from the
date the tenant notified the owner of the dispute.
(4) Tenant access to records. The tenants of any dwelling unit whose electrical consumption is
submetered shall be allowed by the owner to review and copy the master billing for the current
month’s billing period and for the 12 preceding months, and all submeter readings of the entire
apartment house or mobile home park for the current month and for the 12 preceding months.
(5) Estimated bills. Estimated bills shall not be rendered unless the meter has been tampered with or
is out of order, and shall be distinctly marked “estimated bill”.
(6) Overbilling and underbilling. If submetered billings are found to be in error, the owner shall
calculate a billing adjustment. If the tenant is due a refund, an adjustment shall be made for the
entire period of the overcharges. If the tenant was undercharged, the owner may backbill the tenant
for the amount which was underbilled. The backbilling is not to exceed six months unless the owner
can produce records to identify and justify the additional amount of backbilling. If the underbilling
is $50 or more, the owner shall offer to the tenant a deferred payment plan option, for the same
length of time as that of the underbilling. However, in a mobile home park, the mobile home park
owner may not disconnect electric service to a mobile home not leased by the mobile home park
owner if the pad site tenant fails to pay charges arising from an underbilling more than six months
prior to the date the tenant was initially notified of the amount of the undercharges and the total
additional amount due. Furthermore, adjustments for usage by a previous tenant may not be
backbilled to the current tenant.
(7) Level and average payment plans. An owner may offer a level payment plan or average payment
plan consistent with this paragraph.
(A) The payment plan may be one of the following methods:
(i) A level payment plan allowing eligible tenants to pay on a monthly basis a fixed
billing rate of one-twelfth of that tenant’s estimated annual consumption at the
appropriate rates, with provisions for quarterly adjustments as may be determined
based on actual usage.
(ii) An average payment plan allowing tenants to pay on a monthly basis one-twelfth
of the sum of that tenant’s current month’s consumption plus the previous 11
month’s consumption (or an estimate thereof, for a new customer) at the
appropriate customer class rates, plus a portion of any unbilled balance.
Provisions for annual adjustments as may be determined based on actual usage
shall be provided. If at the end of a year the owner determines that he has collected
an amount different than he has been charged by the utility or retail electric
provider, the owner must refund any overcollection and may surcharge any
undercollection over the next year.
(B) Under either of the plans outlined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph the owner is
prohibited from charging the tenant any interest that may accrue. Any seasonal
overcharges or undercharges will be carried by the owner of the complex.
(C) A mobile home park owner may disconnect service to a mobile home not leased by the
mobile home park owner, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, if the pad site tenant
does not fulfill the terms of a level payment plan or an average payment plan.
(D) The owner may collect a deposit from all tenants entering into level payment plans or
average payment plans; the deposit will not exceed an amount equivalent to one-sixth of
the estimated annual billing. Notwithstanding any other provision in these sections, the
owner may retain said deposit for the duration of the level or average payment plan; 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter G. SUBMETERING
Effective 6/10/13
however, the owner shall pay interest on the deposit as is provided in §25.24 of this title
(relating to Credit Requirements and Deposits).
(e) Discontinuance of electric service.
(1) Application. This subsection applies only to mobile homes in a mobile home park that are not
leased by the mobile home park owner. Disconnection of any other dwelling unit by the owner is
governed by Texas Property Code §92.008(b).
(2) Disconnection for delinquent bills.
(A) Electric service may be disconnected only for nonpayment of electric bills. A pad site
tenant’s electric service may be disconnected if a bill has not been paid within 12 days
from the date of issuance and proper notice has been given. Proper notice shall consist of
a separate mailing or hand delivery at least five days prior to a stated date of disconnection,
with the words “termination notice” or similar language prominently displayed on the
notice. The notice shall include the office or street address where a tenant can go during
normal working hours to make arrangements for payment of the bill and for reconnection
of service.
(B) Under these provisions, a pad site tenant’s electric service may be discontinued only for
nonpayment of electric service.
(3) Disconnection on holidays or weekends. Unless a dangerous condition exists, or unless the pad
site tenant requests disconnection, electric service shall not be disconnected on a day, or on a day
immediately preceding a day, when personnel of the mobile home park are not available for the
purpose of making collections and reconnecting electric service.
(4) Disconnection under special circumstances.
(A) Disconnection of ill and disabled. A mobile home park owner shall not disconnect
electric service to a pad site tenant when that tenant establishes that disconnection of
electric service will cause some person residing at the tenant’s mobile home to become
seriously ill or more seriously ill;
(i) Each time a pad site tenant seeks to avoid disconnection of electric service under
this subparagraph, the tenant must accomplish all of the following by the stated
date of disconnection:
(I) have the person’s attending physician (for purposes of this subsection,
the term “physician” shall mean any public health official, including
medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, nurse practitioners, registered
nurses, and any other similar public health official) call or contact the
mobile home park owner by the stated date of disconnection;
(II) have the person’s attending physician submit a written statement to the
mobile home park owner; and
(III) enter into a deferred payment plan.
(ii) The prohibition against electric service termination provided by this subparagraph
shall last 63 days from the issuance of the electric bill or a shorter period agreed
upon by the mobile home park owner and the customer or physician.
(B) Disconnection of energy assistance clients. A mobile home park owner shall not
disconnect electric service to a pad site tenant for a billing period in which the mobile home
park owner receives a pledge, letter of intent, purchase order, or other notification that the
energy assistance provider is forwarding sufficient payment to continue service; and
(C) Disconnection during extreme weather. A mobile home park owner shall not disconnect
electric service to a pad site tenant on a day when:
(i) the previous day’s highest temperature did not exceed 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the temperature is predicted to remain at or below that level for the next 24 hours,
according to the nearest National Weather Service (NWS) reports; or 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter G. SUBMETERING
Effective 6/10/13
(ii) the NWS issues a heat advisory for any county in which the mobile home park is
located, or when such advisory has been issued on any one of the preceding two
calendar days.
(f) Submeters.
(1) Submeter requirements.
(A) Use of submeter. All electrical energy sold by an owner shall be charged for by meter
measurements.
(B) Installation by owner. Unless otherwise authorized by the commission, each owner shall
be responsible for providing, installing, and maintaining all submeters necessary for the
measurement of electrical energy to its tenants.
(2) Submeter records. Each owner shall keep the following records:
(A) Submeter equipment record. Each owner shall keep a record of all of its submeters,
showing the tenant’s address and date of the last test.
(B) Records of submeter tests. All submeter tests shall be properly referenced to the submeter
record provided in this section. The record of each test made shall show the identifying
number of the submeter, the standard meter and other measuring devices used, the date and
kind of test made, by whom made, the error (or percentage of accuracy), and sufficient data
to permit verification of all calculations.
(3) Submeter unit indication. Each meter shall indicate clearly the kilowatt-hours consumed by the
tenant.
(4) Submeter tests on request of tenant. Each owner shall, upon the request of a tenant, and if the
tenant so desires, in the tenant’s or the tenant’s authorized representative’s presence, make a test of
the accuracy of the tenant’s submeter. The test shall be made during reasonable business hours at a
time convenient to the tenant desiring to observe the test. If the submeter tests within the accuracy
standards for self-contained watt-hour meters as established by the latest edition of American
National Standards Institute, Incorporated, (ANSI), Standard C12 (American National Code for
Electricity Metering), a charge of up to $15 may be charged the tenant for making the test. However,
if the submeter has not been tested within a period of one year, or if the submeter’s accuracy is not
within the appropriate accuracy standards, no charge shall be made to the tenant for making the test.
Following completion of any requested test, the owner shall promptly advise the tenant of the results
of the test.
(5) Bill adjustment due to submeter error. If any submeter is found not to be within the accuracy
standards in subsection (f)(4) of this section proper correction shall be made of previous readings.
An adjusted bill shall be rendered in accordance with subsection (d)(6) of this section. If a submeter
is found not to register for any period, unless bypassed or tampered with, the owner may make a
charge for units used, but not metered, for a period not to exceed one month based on amounts used
under similar conditions during periods preceding or subsequent thereto, or during the
corresponding period in previous years.
(6) Bill adjustment due to conversion. If, during the 90-day period preceding the installation of meters
or submeters, an owner increases rental rates, and such increase is attributable to increased costs of
electric service, then such owner shall immediately reduce the rental rate by the amount of such
increase and shall refund all of the increase that has previously been collected within the 90-day
period.
(7) Location of submeters. Submeters, service switches, or cut-off valves in conjunction with the
submeters shall be installed in accordance with the latest edition of ANSI, Standard C12, and will
be readily accessible for reading, testing, and inspection, with minimum interference and
inconvenience to the tenant.
(8) Submeter testing facilities and equipment.
(A) Qualified expert. Each owner engaged in electric submetering shall engage an
independent qualified expert to provide such instruments and other equipment and facilities
as may be necessary to make the submeter tests required by this section. Such equipment 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter G. SUBMETERING
Effective 6/10/13
and facilities shall generally conform to the ANSI, Standard C12, unless otherwise
prescribed by the commission, and shall be available at all reasonable times for the
inspection by its authorized representatives.
(B) Portable standards. Each owner engaged in electrical submetering shall, unless
specifically excused by the commission, provide or utilize a testing firm which provides
portable test instruments as necessary for testing billing submeters.
(C) Reference standards. Each owner shall provide or have access to suitable indicating
instruments as reference standards for insuring the accuracy of shop and portable
instruments used for testing billing submeters.
(D) Testing of reference standards. All reference standards shall be submitted once each
year or on a scheduled basis approved by the commission to a standardizing laboratory of
recognized standing, for the purpose of testing and adjustment.
(E) Calibration of test equipment. All shop and portable instruments used for testing billing
submeters shall be calibrated by comparing them with a reference standard at least every
120 days during the time such test instruments are being regularly used. Test equipment
shall at all times be accompanied by a certified calibration card signed by the proper
authority, giving the date when it was last certified and adjusted. Records of certifications
and calibrations shall be kept on file in the office of the owner.
(9) Accuracy requirements for submeters.
(A) Limits. No submeter that exceeds the test calibration limits for self-contained watt-hour
meters as set by the ANSI, Standard C12, shall be placed in service or left in service. All
electrical current transformers, potential transformers, or other such devices used in
conjunction with an electric submeter shall be considered part of the submeter and must
also meet test calibration and phase angle limits set by the ANSI Standard C12 and the
ANSI Standard C57.13 for revenue billing. A nameplate shall be attached to each
transformer and shall include or refer to calibration and phase angle data and other
information required by the ANSI Standard C12 and the ANSI Standard C57.13 for
revenue billing. Whenever on installation, periodic, or other tests, an electric submeter or
transformer is found to exceed these limits, it shall be adjusted, repaired, or replaced.
(B) Adjustments. Submeters shall be adjusted as closely as possible to the condition of zero
error. The tolerances are specified only to allow for necessary variations.
(10) Submeter tests prior to installation. No submeter shall be placed in service unless its accuracy
has been established. If any submeter is removed from actual service and replaced by another
submeter for any purpose whatsoever, it shall be properly tested and adjusted before being placed
in service again.
(11) Testing of electric submeters in service. Standard electromechanical single stator watt-hour
meters with permanent braking magnets shall be tested in accordance with the ANSI Standard C12
for periodic, variable interval, or statistical sampling testing programs. All other types of submeters
shall be tested at least annually unless specified otherwise by the commission.
(12) Restriction. Unless otherwise provided by the commission, no dwelling unit in an apartment house
or mobile home park may be submetered unless all dwelling units are submetered.
(13) Same type meters required. All submeters which are served by the same master meter shall be of
the same type, such as induction or electronic.

Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 12/29/99
§25.172. Goal for Natural Gas.
(a) Applicability. This section applies to a power generation company, municipally owned utility, or electric
cooperative that installs new generation capacity in this state after January 1, 2000. The provisions of
subsection (g) of this section shall apply to a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative only if it
has adopted customer choice pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §40.051(a) or §41.051(a)
respectively. This section does not apply to an electric utility not subject to PURA Chapter 39, pursuant to
§39.102(c), until the expiration of its freeze period.
(b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage, to the extent permitted by law, owners of new
generating capacity, other than capacity from renewable energy technologies, to use natural gas as their
primary fuel source. The commission shall institute a natural gas energy credits trading program to ensure
that 50% of all new generating capacity except, capacity from renewable energy technologies, installed in
this state after January 1, 2000, uses natural gas as its primary fuel.
(c) Definitions.
(1) New generating capacity — Nameplate generating capacity of a facility installed in this state after
January 1, 2000, except capacity based on a renewable energy technology. This definition of new
generating capacity does not include modifications to previously installed generating facilities that
merely increase the efficiency of, or reduce emissions from, such facilities. For the purposes of this
section the phrase “new generating capacity purchased” refers to the purchase of all or part of an
installed unit, and not to the purchase of capacity or energy from an installed unit.
(2) Natural gas energy credit (NGEC) — A NGEC shall be granted for each megawatt of new
generating capacity fueled by natural gas. The commission shall issue NGECs to each power
generation company, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that installs new, gas-fired
generating capacity. Each credit shall be issued once and shall be valid so long as the plant meets
reasonable performance standards; if a plant no longer meets reasonable performance standards or is
retired, its associated NGECs shall be revoked.
(3) Reasonable performance standards — Those standards which, when applied to new natural gasfired capacity, would reasonably be expected to maximize energy output consistent with industry
standards widely accepted at the time of installation and for the technology employed.
(d) Natural gas energy credit requirement. Upon activation of the NGEC trading program the number of
NGECs required to be owned or held by each power generation company, municipally owned utility, and
electric cooperative in this state shall not be less than its new non-gas-fired generating capacity in megawatts.
Upon retirement of new non-gas-fired generating capacity, the NGEC requirement shall be reduced by the
capacity of the facility that is retired.
(1) The requirements of this section may be satisfied by owning new generating capacity fired primarily
by natural gas, for which NGECs have not been sold to a third party, or by holding NGECs acquired
from third parties, either in connection with purchasing capacity or on a stand-alone basis, or by any
combination thereof.
(2) A power generation company, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that does not own
new generation capacity shall not be required to obtain any natural gas credits.
(e) Program activation. The commission shall activate the natural gas energy credits trading program if it
determines that within three years from the date of the evaluation, new generating capacity in Texas that is
fueled primarily by natural gas may fall below 55% of all new generating capacity. However, the commission
may accelerate or delay implementation of individual NGEC requirements in the event the commission 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 12/29/99
determines that such action is in the public interest. This analysis shall be based on the annual reports filed
pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. If the commission activates the program, it shall:
(1) require power generators, municipally owned utilities, and electric cooperatives to demonstrate that
for each megawatt of new non-gas fired generating capacity it owns or holds natural gas energy credits
equal to that amount of capacity; and
(2) Within 240 days, adopt rules that will determine the conditions for compliance and penalties for
noncompliance with this section for each power generator, municipally owned utility, and electric
cooperative.
(f) Natural gas energy credit trading. The commission shall be responsible for issuing, tracking and assigning
serial numbers to NGECs in accordance with this section. The total number of NGECs at any time shall
equal the amount of new gas-fired generating capacity (MW) that uses natural gas as its primary fuel source,
less any NGECs revoked to reflect plant retirements or poor performance relative to the standards referred to
in subsection (c)(4) of this section. NGECs may be traded among power generators, municipally owned
utilities, electric cooperatives, and other interested parties.
(g) Environmental benefits and “green” electricity. Each retail electric provider, municipally owned utility,
or electric cooperative that has adopted customer choice:
(1) may emphasize that natural gas produced in this state is the cleanest burning fossil fuel;
(2) may market electricity generated using natural gas produced in this state as environmentally beneficial
and may label such generation as “green” electricity under this section if such electricity is generated
exclusively from generating capacity based on natural gas technologies that use natural gas produced
in this state. The use of fuel oil in a generating facility that otherwise relies on natural gas as its sole
fuel shall not preclude labeling output from the facility as “green” if the fuel oil is used for:
(A) emergency backup;
(B) periodic testing; or
(C) a lubricant in de minimus amounts; and
(3) shall provide sufficient proof, upon request, that any marketing representation that it makes that its
electricity is “green” are consistent with this section.
(h) Annual reports.
(1) Beginning in 2001, no later than February 14th of each year, each registered power generation
company, municipally owned utility, and electric cooperative shall file with the commission on a form
prescribed by the commission, the following information regarding new generating facilities it owns
or operates in Texas:
(A) For each unit of new generating capacity:
(i) plant location and name;
(ii) nameplate capacity (in megawatts) of each unit;
(iii) ownership share of each unit;
(iv) primary fuel type of new generating capacity;
(v) Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission turbine or boiler permit number and
date; and
(vi) date that commercial operation began.
(B) Forecasted generation additions by fuel type for the next three calendar years (for the next five
calendar years if the fuel type is coal, lignite, or nuclear):
(i) plant location and name;
(ii) nameplate capacity (MW) of each unit;
(iii) ownership share of each unit;
(iv) primary fuel type of new generating capacity;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 12/29/99
(v) Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission turbine or boiler permit number and
date; and
(vi) date that commercial operation will begin.
(C) Data on holdings of natural energy gas credits:
(i) current holdings of credits by serial number; and
(ii) any purchase or sale of credits by serial number during the previous calendar year.
(2) Based on the annual reports, not later that April 15th of each year, the commission shall award NGECs
for new-gas fired capacity installed in the previous year.
(3) Beginning in 2001, and no later than May 15th of each year, the commission shall publish, in aggregate
form only, the information submitted in compliance with this rule, including calculations that show
whether the prior year’s generating capacity in Texas is in compliance with this section and whether
capacity for the following three years is likely to be in compliance with the natural gas usage goals,
based on the forecast information submitted.
(i) Texas natural gas – market conditions. The commission shall consult with the Railroad Commission of
Texas, which shall monitor the Texas natural gas industry and conduct appropriate market studies to
determine whether an adequate supply of Texas natural gas for power generation exists. If necessary, the
commission shall develop additional safeguards to ensure that natural gas produced in this state remains the
preferred fuel for power generation.

(d) Certification of renewable energy facilities. The commission will certify all renewable facilities that will
produce either REC offsets, RECs, solar RECs, or compliance premiums for sale in the trading program. To
be awarded REC offsets, RECs, solar RECs, or compliance premiums, a power generator must complete the
certification process described in this subsection. The program administrator must not award REC offsets,
RECs, solar RECs, or compliance premiums for energy produced by a power generator before it has been
certified by the commission.
(1) The designated representative of the generating facility must file an application with the commission
on a form approved by the commission for each renewable energy generation facility. At a
minimum, the application must include the location, owner, technology, and rated capacity of the
facility, and must demonstrate that the facility meets the resource eligibility criteria in subsection
(e) of this section. Any subsequent changes to the information in the application must be filed with
the commission within 30 days of such changes.
(2) No later than 30 days after the designated representative files the certification form with the
commission, the commission will inform both the program administrator and the designated
representative whether the renewable facility has met the certification requirements. At that time,
the commission will either certify the renewable facility as eligible to receive REC offsets, RECs,
solar RECs, or compliance premiums or describe any insufficiencies to be remedied. If the

action.
(3) Upon receiving notice of certification of new facilities, the program administrator will create a REC
account for the designated representative of the renewable resource.
(4) The commission or program administrator may make on-site visits to any certified facility, and the
commission will decertify any facility if it is not in compliance with the provisions of this
subsection.
(5) A decertified renewable generator may not be awarded RECs, solar RECs, or compliance premiums.
However, any RECs, solar RECs, REC offsets, or compliance premiums awarded by the program
administrator and transferred to a retail entity prior to the decertification remain valid.
(6) Participants that were registered and certified to participate in the trading program prior to the
effective date of this rule continue to be registered and certified under this subsection and are not
required to re-register or be recertified to participate in the trading program.
(e) Renewable energy credits, solar renewable energy credits, and compliance premiums.
(1) Renewable energy credits (RECs).
(A) Facilities eligible for producing RECs in the trading program. For a renewable facility
to be eligible to produce RECs for the trading program it must be either a new facility, a
small producer, or a repowered facility as defined in subsection (c) of this section and must
also meet the requirements of this subsection.
(i) A renewable energy resource must not be ineligible under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph and must be certified under subsection (d) of this section.
(ii) For a renewable energy technology that requires fossil fuel, the facility’s use of
fossil fuel must not exceed 25.0% of the total annual fuel input on a British
thermal unit (BTU) or equivalent basis.
(iii) For a renewable energy technology that requires the use of fossil fuel that exceeds
2.0% of the total annual fuel input on a BTU or equivalent basis, RECs can only
be earned on the renewable portion of the production. A renewable energy
resource using a technology described by this clause must comply with the
following requirements:
(I) A meter must be installed and periodic tests of the heat content of the
fuel must be conducted to measure the amount of fossil fuel input on a
British thermal unit (BTU) or equivalent basis that is used at the facility;
(II) The renewable energy resource must calculate the electricity generated
by the unit in MWh, based on the BTUs (or equivalent) produced by the
fossil fuel and the efficiency of the renewable energy resource, subtract
the MWh generated with fossil fuel input from the total MWh of
generation and report the renewable energy generated to the program
administrator;
(III) The renewable energy resource must report the generation to the
program administrator in the measurements, format, and frequency
prescribed by the program administrator, which may include a
description of the methodology for calculating the non-renewable energy
produced by the resource; and
(IV) The renewable energy resource is subject to audit to verify the accuracy
of the data submitted to the program administrator and compliance with
this section, to be conducted by the program administrator or an
independent third party as requested by the program administrator. If

performed at the expense of the renewable energy resource. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 1/01/24
(P 55323)
(iv) The output of the facility must be readily capable of being physically metered and
verified in Texas by the program administrator. Energy from a renewable facility
that is delivered into a transmission system where it is commingled with
electricity from non-renewable resources before being metered cannot be verified
as delivered to Texas customers. A facility is not ineligible if the facility is a
generation-offset, off-grid, or on-site distributed renewable facility and it
otherwise meets the requirements of this subparagraph.
(v) For a municipally owned utility operating a gas distribution system, any
production or acquisition of landfill gas that is directly supplied to the gas
distribution system is eligible to produce RECs based upon the conversion of the
thermal energy in BTUs to electric energy in kWh using for the conversion factor
the systemwide average heat rate of the gas-fired units of the combined utility’s
electric system as measured in BTUs per kWh.
(vi) For industry-standard thermal technologies, the RECs can be earned only on the
renewable portion of energy production.
(B) Facilities not eligible for producing RECs in the trading program. A renewable facility
is not eligible to produce RECs if it is:
(i) A renewable energy capacity addition associated with an emissions reductions
project described in Health and Safety Code §382.05193, that is used to satisfy
the permit requirements in Health and Safety Code §382.0519; or
(ii) An existing facility that is not a small producer as defined in subsection (c) of this
section or has not been repowered as permitted under subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph.
(2) Solar renewable energy credits (solar RECs) for solar RPS.
(A) Facilities eligible for producing solar RECs and compliance premiums for the solar
RPS. For a renewable facility to be eligible to produce solar RECs and compliance
premiums for the solar RPS, it must be either a new facility, a small producer, or a
repowered facility as defined in subsection (c) of this section and must also meet the
requirements of this paragraph:
(i) A renewable energy resource must not be ineligible under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph and must register under subsection (d) of this section.
(ii) A facility must only use renewable energy technologies that exclusively rely on
an energy source that is naturally regenerated, over a short time and derived
directly from the sun.
(iii) The output of the facility must be readily capable of being physically metered and
verified in Texas by the program administrator. Energy from a solar renewable
facility that is delivered into a transmission system where it is commingled with
electricity from non-solar renewable resources before being metered cannot be
verified as delivered to Texas customers. A facility is not ineligible by virtue of
the fact that the facility is a generation-offset, off-grid, or on-site distributed solar
renewable facility if it otherwise meets the requirements of this subparagraph.
(iv) For repowered facilities, a facility is eligible to earn solar RECs on all renewable
energy produced up to a capacity of 150 MW. A repowered facility with a
capacity greater than 150 MW may earn solar RECs for the energy produced in
proportion to 150 divided by nameplate capacity.
(B) Facilities not eligible for producing solar RECs and compliance premiums for use in
the solar RPS. A renewable facility is not eligible to produce solar RECs and compliance
premiums for use in the solar RPS if it is: 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 1/01/24
(P 55323)
(i) A renewable energy capacity addition associated with an emissions reductions
project described in Health and Safety Code §382.05193, that is used to satisfy
the permit requirements in Health and Safety Code §382.0519; or
(ii) An existing facility that is not a small producer as defined in subsection (c) of this
section or has not been repowered as permitted under this subsection.
(3) Compliance premiums. The program administrator will award compliance premiums to solar REC
generators certified by the commission under subsection (d) of this section.
(A) For eligible solar technologies as set forth in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection, one
compliance premium will be created and awarded in conjunction with each solar REC
generated January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2024. Compliance premiums will not be
created or awarded after December 31, 2024.
(B) Except as provided in this paragraph, the award, retirement, trade, and registration of
compliance premiums must follow the requirements of paragraph (4) of this subsection and
subsections (f) and (i) of this section.
(C) A compliance premium may be used by any retail entity toward its solar RPS requirement
under subsection (f)(2) of this section.
(D) A compliance premium may not be used by any retail entity toward the RPS requirement
after the settlement period for 2024 compliance period.
(E) The program administrator must increase the statewide RPS requirement calculated under
subsection (f)(2)(A) of this section by the number of compliance premiums retired during
the previous compliance period.
(4) Production, transfer, and expiration of RECs and solar RECs. The production, transfer, and
expiration of RECs and solar RECs must follow the requirements of this paragraph. RECs and solar
RECs issued through December 31, 2023, continue to exist and retire consistent with their issuance.
(A) The owner of a renewable resource will earn one REC or solar REC when a MWh is
metered at that renewable resource. The program administrator will record the energy in
metered MWh and credit the REC account of the renewable resource that generated the
energy on a quarterly basis. Quarterly production must be rounded to the nearest whole
MWh, with fractions of 0.5 MWh or greater rounded up.
(B) The transfer of RECs or solar RECs between parties is effective only when the transfer is
recorded by the program administrator.
(C) The program administrator will require that RECs or solar RECs be adequately identified
prior to recording a transfer and must issue an acknowledgement of the transaction to
parties upon provision of adequate information. At a minimum, the following information
must be provided:
(i) identification of the parties;
(ii) REC or solar REC serial number, REC or solar REC issue date, and the renewable
resource that produced the REC or solar REC;
(iii) the number of RECs or solar RECs to be transferred; and
(iv) the transaction date.
(D) A retail entity must surrender RECs or solar RECs to the program administrator for
retirement from the market for a compliance period. The program administrator will
document all REC and solar REC retirements annually.
(E) On or after each April 1, the program administrator will retire RECs and solar RECs that
have not been retired by retail entities and have reached the end of their compliance life.
(F) The program administrator may establish a procedure to ensure that the award, transfer,
and retirement of RECs and solar RECs are accurately recorded.
(G) The issue date of RECs or solar RECs generated by renewable energy resources will
coincide with the compliance period in which the credits are created. All RECs and solar 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 1/01/24
(P 55323)
RECs will have a compliance life of three compliance periods, after which the program
administrator will retire them from the trading program.
(H) Each REC or solar REC that is not used in the compliance period in which it was created
may be banked and is valid for the next two compliance periods. For purposes of this
subparagraph, calendar year 2023 counts as a single compliance period.
(f) Solar renewable portfolio standard (solar RPS).
(1) Solar RECs may be generated, transferred, and retired by renewable energy power generators
certified under subsection (d) of this section, retail entities, and other market participants as set forth
in subsection (e)(4) of this section. Solar RECs generated by renewable energy resources in the
calendar year 2025 may be used by any retail entity toward the solar RPS requirement for the
compliance period beginning January 1, 2025, or on a voluntary basis in the subsequent years.
(A) The program administrator will allocate a solar RPS requirement among all retail entities
as a percentage of the retail sales of each retail entity as set forth in paragraph (2) of this
subsection. Each retail entity is responsible for retiring sufficient solar RECs as set forth
in paragraph (2) of this subsection and subsection (e)(4) of this section for the 2024 and
2025 compliance periods. The requirement to retire solar RECs to comply with this section
becomes effective on the date a retail entity begins serving retail electric customers in
Texas or, for an electric utility, as specified by law.
(B) Solar RECs will be credited on an energy basis as set forth in subsection (e)(4) of this
section.
(C) A municipally-owned utility or distribution cooperative possessing renewable resources
that meet the requirements of subsection (e)(2)(A) of this section may sell solar RECs
generated by such a resource to retail entities as set forth in subsection (e)(4) of this section.
(D) Except where specifically stated, the provisions of this section apply uniformly to all
participants in the trading program.
(E) The solar RPS end on September 1, 2025.
(2) Allocation of solar RPS requirement to retail entities. The program administrator must allocate
solar RPS requirements among retail entities. The solar RPS terminates September 1, 2025, but is
subject to the settlement period following that termination date. The program administrator must
use the following methodology to determine the total annual solar RPS requirement for a given year
and the final solar RPS allocation for individual retail entities:
(A) The total statewide solar RPS requirement for each applicable compliance period must be
calculated in terms of MWh and must be equal to the applicable capacity requirement set
forth in this paragraph multiplied by 8,760 hours for the 2024 compliance period and 5,840
hours for the 2025 compliance period, multiplied by the appropriate capacity conversion
factor set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection. The solar renewable energy capacity
requirements for the compliance periods beginning January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025,
respectively are:
(i) 1,310 MW of resources from New Facilities in the 2024 compliance period; and
(ii) 655 MW of resources from New Facilities in the 2025 compliance period.
(B) The final solar RPS allocation for an individual retail entity for a compliance period must
be calculated as follows:
(i) Prior to the preliminary solar RPS allocation, each retail entity’s total retail energy
sales are reduced to exclude the consumption of customers that opt out in
accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection. Each retail entity’s preliminary
solar RPS allocation is determined by dividing its total retail energy sales in Texas
by the total retail sales in Texas of all retail entities and multiplying that
percentage by the total statewide solar RPS requirement for that compliance
period. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 1/01/24
(P 55323)
(ii) The adjusted solar RPS allocation for each retail entity that is entitled to an offset
is determined by reducing its preliminary solar RPS allocation by the offsets to
which it qualifies, as determined under paragraph (5) of this subsection, with the
maximum reduction equal to the retail entity’s preliminary solar RPS allocation.
The total reduction for all retail entities is equal to the total usable offsets for that
compliance period.
(iii) Each retail entity’s final solar RPS allocation for a compliance period must be
increased to recapture the total usable offsets calculated under clause (ii) of this
subparagraph. The additional solar RPS allocation must be calculated by dividing
the retail entity’s preliminary RPS allocation by the total preliminary solar RPS
allocation of all retail entities. This fraction must be multiplied by the total usable
offsets for that compliance period and this amount must be added to the retail
entity’s adjusted solar RPS allocation to produce the retail entity’s final solar RPS
allocation for the compliance period.
(C) Concurrent with determining final individual solar RPS allocations for the current
compliance period in accordance with this subsection, the program administrator must
recalculate the final solar RPS allocations for the previous compliance periods, taking into
account corrections to retail sales resulting from resettlements. The difference between a
retail entity’s corrected final solar RPS allocation and its original final solar RPS allocation
for the previous compliance periods must be added to or subtracted from the retail entity’s
final solar RPS allocation for the current compliance period.
(3) Calculation of capacity conversion factor. The capacity conversion factor used by the program
administrator to allocate solar RECs to retail entities must be calculated during the first quarter of
the 2024 compliance period and will be utilized through the end of the solar RPS. The capacity
conversion factor must:
(A) Be based on actual generator performance data for the previous two years for solar
renewable resources in the trading program during that period for which at least 12 months
of performance data are available;
(B) Represent a weighted average of generator performance; and
(C) Use all actual generator performance data that is available for each solar renewable
resource, excluding data for testing periods.
(4) Opt-out notice.
(A) A customer receiving electrical service at transmission-level voltage who submits an optout notice to the commission for the applicable compliance period must have its load
excluded from the solar RPS calculation. Any opt-out notice submitted under the RPS as
it existed prior to the effective date of this section continues to apply to the solar RPS for
the compliance period as specified in this subsection.
(B) An investor-owned utility that is subject to the solar RPS requirement under this section
must not collect costs attributable to the solar RPS from an eligible customer who has
submitted an opt-out notice. An investor-owned utility whose rates include the cost of
solar RECs must file a tariff to implement this paragraph, not later than 30 days after the
effective date of this section.
(C) A customer opt-out notice must be filed in the commission-designated project number
before the beginning of a compliance period for the notice to be effective for that period.
Each opt-out notice must include the name of the individual customer opting out, the
customer’s ESI IDs, the retail entities serving those ESI IDs, and the term for which the
notice is effective, which may not exceed two years. The customer opting out must also
provide the information included in the opt-out notice directly to ERCOT and may request
that ERCOT protect the customer’s ESI ID and consumption as confidential information.
A customer may revoke a notice under this paragraph at any time prior to the end of a 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS

DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 1/01/24
(P 55323)
compliance period by filing a letter in the designated project number and providing notice
to ERCOT.
(5) Nomination and award of REC offsets.
(A) A REP, municipally-owned utility, G&T cooperative, distribution cooperative, or an
affiliate of a REP, municipally-owned utility, or distribution cooperative, may apply offsets
to meet all or a portion of its solar RPS requirement, as calculated in paragraph (2) of this
subsection, only if those offsets were nominated in a filing with the commission by June
1, 2001.
(B) The program administrator must award offsets consistent with the commission’s actions to
verify designations of REC offsets and with this section.
(C) REC offsets must be equal to the average annual MWh output of an existing resource for
the years 1991-2000 or the entire life of the existing resource, whichever is less.
(D) REC offsets qualify for use in a compliance period under paragraph (2) of this subsection
only to the extent that:
(i) The resource producing the REC offset has continuously since September 1, 1999,
been owned by or its output has been committed under contract to a utility,
municipally-owned utility, or cooperative (or successor in interest) nominating
the resource under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or, if the resource has been
committed under a contract that expired after September 1, 1999, and before
January 1, 2002, it was owned by or its output was committed under contract to a
utility, municipally-owned utility, or cooperative on January 1, 2002; and
(ii) The facility producing the REC offsets is operated and producing energy during
the compliance period in a manner consistent with historic practice.
(E) If the production of energy from a facility that is eligible for an award of REC offsets ceases
for any reason, or if the power purchase agreement with the facility’s owner (or successor
in interest) that is referred to in subparagraph (D)(i) of this paragraph has lapsed or is no
longer in effect, the retail entity must no longer be awarded REC offsets related to the
facility.
(F) REC offsets must not be traded.
(g) Renewable energy credits trading program. The program administrator must maintain a voluntary
banking and accreditation system to facilitate a voluntary renewable energy credit trading program. The
program administrator must maintain the records, accounts, RECs, and compliance premiums from the
trading program as it existed prior to August 31, 2023, and prior to the effective date of this section, as
applicable.
(1) RECs may be generated, transferred, and retired by renewable energy power generators certified
under subsection (d) of this section, retail entities, and other market participants as set forth in this
section. For purposes of this subsection, there is no distinction between RECs and solar RECs.
(A) A power generating company may participate in the trading program and may generate
RECs and buy or sell RECs as set forth in subsection (e)(4) of this section.
(B) RECs must be credited on an energy basis as set forth in subsection (e)(4) of this section.
(C) A municipally-owned utility or distribution cooperative possessing renewable resources
that meet the requirements of subsection (e)(1)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of this section may sell
RECs generated by such a resource to retail entities as set forth in subsection (e)(4) of this
section.
(2) The program administrator may assign additional attributes to RECs, such as more precise REC
generation timestamps, to allow buyers to distinguish between RECs.
(h) Responsibilities of the program administrator. At a minimum, the program administrator must perform
the following functions:

to an independent third party, subject to commission approval;
(8) Make public each month the total energy sales of retail entities in Texas for the previous month;
(9) Perform audits of generators participating in the trading program to verify accuracy of metered
production data;
(10) Allocate the RPS requirement to each retail entity in accordance with subsection (f)(2) of this
section; and
(11) Submit an annual report to the commission. The program administrator must submit a report to the
commission on or before May 15 of each calendar year. The report must contain information
pertaining to renewable energy power generators and retail entities. At a minimum, the report must
contain:
(A) the amount of existing and new renewable energy capacity in MW installed in the state by
technology type, the owner/operator of each facility, the date each facility began to produce
energy, the amount of energy generated in megawatt-hours (MWh) each quarter for all
capacity participating in the trading program or that was retired from service; and
(B) a listing of all retail entities participating in the trading program, each retail entity’s solar
RPS requirement, the number of offsets used by each retail entity, the number of solar
RECs retired by each retail entity, the number of compliance premiums retired by each

(i) Settlement process. The 90 days following the compliance period is the settlement period during which the
following actions will occur:
(1) 30 days after the end of the compliance period, the program administrator will notify each retail
entity of its total solar RPS requirement for the previous compliance period as determined under
subsection (f)(2) of this section.
(2) 90 days after the end of the compliance period, each retail entity must submit solar RECs or
compliance premiums to the program administrator from its account equivalent to its solar RPS
requirement for the previous compliance period. If the retail entity does not submit sufficient solar
RECs or compliance premiums to satisfy its obligation, the retail entity is subject to the penalty
provisions in subsection (j) of this section.
(3) The program administrator may request the commission to adjust the deadlines set forth in this

CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 1/01/24
(P 55323)
(j) Penalties and enforcement. If by April 1 of the year following a compliance period in which the solar RPS
was in effect the program administrator determines that a retail entity has not retired sufficient solar RECs or
compliance premiums to satisfy its allocation of the solar RPS, the retail entity is subject to an administrative
penalty, under PURA §15.023, of $50 per MWh that is deficient.
(k) Microgenerators and REC aggregators. A REC aggregator may manage the participation of multiple
microgenerators in the trading program. The program administrator will assign to the REC aggregator all
RECs or solar RECs accrued by the microgenerators who are under a REC management contract with the
REC aggregator.
(1) The microgenerator’s units must be installed and connected to the grid in compliance with
commission Substantive Rules, applicable interconnection standards adopted under the commission
Substantive Rules, and federal rules.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (e)(1)(A)(iii) of this section, a REC aggregator may use any of the
following methods for reporting generation to the program administrator, as long as the same
method is used for each microgenerator in an aggregation unit, as defined by the REC aggregator.
A REC aggregator may have more than one aggregation and may choose any of the methods listed
below for each aggregation unit.
(A) The REC aggregator may provide the program administrator with production data that is
measured and verified by an electronic meter that meets ANSI C12 standards and that will
be separate from the aggregator’s billing meter for the service address and for which the
billing data and the renewable energy data are separate and verifiable data. Such actual
data must be collected and transmitted within a reasonable time and is subject to
verification by the program administrator. REC aggregators using this method will be
awarded one REC for every MWh generated.
(B) The REC aggregator may provide the program administrator with sufficient information
for the program administrator to estimate with reasonable accuracy the output of each unit,
based on known or observed information that correlates closely with the generation output.
REC aggregators using this method will be awarded one REC for every 1.25 MWh
generated. After installing the unit, the certified technician must provide the
microgenerator, the REC aggregator, and the program administrator the information
required by the program administrator under this paragraph.
(C) A generating unit may have a meter that transmits actual generation data to the program
administrator using applicable protocols and procedures. Such protocols and procedures
must require that actual data be collected and transmitted within a reasonable time. REC
aggregators using this method will be awarded one REC for every MWh generated.
(3) REC aggregators must register with the commission and the program administrator and must also
register to participate in the trading program.
(4) A microgenerator participating in the trading program individually without the assistance of a REC
aggregator must comply with the requirements of this subsection.
(5) REC aggregators and microgenerators that were registered and certified to participate in the trading
program prior to the effective date of this section continue to be registered and certified under this
subsection and are not required to re-register or be recertified to participate in the trading program.
(l) Effective date. This section is effective January 1, 2024. The version of this rule that existed prior to January
1, 2024 applies through December 31, 2023, including the settlement of the 2023 compliance period, except
that the 2023 compliance period ended on August 31, 2023, and RPS calculation must use 5,832 hours rather
than 8,760 hours.

circuit on the Alibates-AJ Swope-Windmill-Ogallala-Tule Canyon transmission line, the commission is not
required to consider the factors under Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §37.056(c)(1) and (2).
(b) Designation of Competitive Renewable Energy Zones. The designation of Competitive Renewable Energy
Zones (CREZs) pursuant to PURA §39.904(g) shall be made through one or more contested-case proceedings
initiated by commission staff, for which the commission shall establish a procedural schedule. The
commission shall consider the need for proceedings to determine CREZs in 2007.
(1) Commission staff shall initiate a contested case proceeding upon receiving the information required
by paragraph (2) of this subsection. Any interested entity that participates in the contested case may
nominate a region for CREZ designation. An entity may submit any evidence it deems appropriate
in support of its nomination, but it shall include information prescribed in paragraph (2)(A) - (C) of
this subsection.
(2) By December 1, 2006, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) shall provide to the
commission a study of the wind energy production potential statewide, and of the transmission
constraints that are most likely to limit the deliverability of electricity from wind energy resources.
ERCOT shall consult with other regional transmission organizations, independent organizations,
independent system operators, or utilities in its analysis of regions of Texas outside the ERCOT
power region. At a minimum, the study submitted by ERCOT shall include:

for planned renewable energy resources, leasing agreements with landowners in a proposed CREZ,
and letters of credit representing dollars per MW of proposed renewable generation resources,
posted with ERCOT, that the developer intends to install and the area of interest are examples of
financial commitment by developers to a CREZ. The commission may also consider projects for
which a TSP, ERCOT, or another independent system operator is conducting an interconnection
study; and any other factors for which parties have provided evidence as indications of financial
commitment.
(2) A non-utility entity’s commitment to build and own transmission facilities dedicated to delivering
the output of renewable energy resources in a proposed CREZ to the transmission system of a TSP
in Texas or a deposit or payment to secure or fund the construction of such transmission facilities
by an electric utility or a transmission utility to deliver the output of a renewable generation project
in Texas is an indication of the entity’s financial commitment to a CREZ.
(d) Plan to develop transmission capacity.
(1) After the issuance of a final order in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section, entities
interested in constructing the transmission improvements shall submit expressions of interest to the
commission. The commission shall select the entity or entities responsible for constructing the
transmission improvements, establish a schedule by which the improvements shall be completed,
and specify any additional reporting requirements or other measures deemed appropriate by the
commission to ensure that entities complete the ordered improvements in a timely manner.

(e) Certificates of convenience and necessity.
(1) Not later than three years after a commission final order designating a CREZ, each TSP selected to
build and own transmission facilities for that CREZ shall file all required CREZ CCN applications.
The commission may grant an extension to this deadline for good cause. The commission may
establish a filing schedule for the CCN applications.
(2) A CCN application for a transmission project intended to serve a CREZ, except an application filed
pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection (a) of this section, shall address all the
criteria in PURA §37.056, including the criteria in PURA §37.056(c)(1) and (2).
(3) In determining whether financial commitment for a CREZ is sufficient under PURA §39.904(g)(3)
to grant CCNs for transmission facilities for the CREZ, the commission shall consider the following
evidence of financial commitment by renewable generators:
(A) capacity represented by installed generation located in one or more of the counties that lie
in whole or in part within the CREZ;
(B) capacity represented by generation projects under construction that are located in one or
more of the counties that lie in whole or in part within the CREZ and that will be operational
within six months of the final order in a financial commitment proceeding. Evidence that
the project will be operational within six months may include documentation showing that
a construction contractor has been hired, that preliminary site work has begun, that the
project financing has closed, or similar indicators of the status of the project;
(C) capacity represented by planned generation projects that are located in one or more of the
counties that lie in whole or in part within the CREZ and that have a signed IA with a TSP
that has been defined in subsection (a)(2)(E) of this section designated to build and own
transmission facilities for that CREZ; and
(D) capacity represented by collateral posted by generators for the CREZ that complies with
paragraph (7) of this subsection.
(4) Financial commitment for a CREZ is sufficient under PURA §39.904(g)(3) to grant CCNs for
transmission facilities for the CREZ if the sum of the renewable generating capacity under any
combination of paragraph (3)(A), (B), (C), and (D) of this subsection is at least 50% of the
designated generating capacity for the CREZ. Fifty percent of the designated generating capacity
for the Panhandle A CREZ approved by the commission in Docket Number 33672 shall be
considered to be 1,595.5 MW. Fifty percent of the designated generating capacity for the Panhandle
B CREZ approved by the commission in Docket Number 33672 shall be considered to be 1,196.5
MW.
(5) Installed renewable generation, renewable generation projects under construction, and planned
renewable generation projects with signed IAs in the McCamey, Central, and Central West CREZs
approved by the commission in Docket Number 33672 satisfy the financial commitment test set
forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection for those CREZs and therefore financial commitment by
renewable generators for those CREZs is sufficient under PURA §39.904(g)(3) to grant CCNs for
transmission facilities for those CREZs. This finding of sufficient financial commitment shall be
recognized in the CCN proceedings for transmission facilities for those CREZs and shall not be
addressed further in those proceedings.
(6) Commission staff shall initiate a single proceeding for the commission to determine whether there
is sufficient financial commitment under PURA §39.904(g)(3) by renewable generators for the
Panhandle A and Panhandle B CREZs approved by the commission in Docket Number 33672 to
grant CCNs for transmission facilities for those CREZs. If the commission determines that there is
sufficient financial commitment for one of those CREZs, that finding shall be recognized in the
CCN proceedings for transmission facilities for that CREZ, as identified in the commission’s order
in the proceeding initiated pursuant to this paragraph, and shall not be addressed further in the CCN
proceedings. If the commission determines that the Panhandle A or Panhandle B CREZ does not
satisfy the financial commitment test in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the commission may:

DIVISION 1: RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND USE OF NATURAL GAS
Effective 7/5/16
(A) consider other evidence of financial commitment that the commission finds relevant under
PURA §39.904(g)(3);
(B) find that the financial commitment requirement for that CREZ has been met if the
commission determines that significant financial commitment exists in that CREZ and that
the CREZ is sufficiently interrelated with a CREZ that has satisfied the financial
commitment test;
(C) delay the filing of CREZ CCN applications for that CREZ until the commission conducts
a subsequent proceeding in which it finds sufficient financial commitment for that CREZ
in accordance with the financial commitment provisions of this subsection; or
(D) take other appropriate action.
(7) A renewable generator that elects to post collateral pursuant to paragraph (3)(D) of this subsection
shall comply with the following requirements:
(A) The renewable generator shall provide a letter of intent to post collateral in a proceeding
conducted pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection. The renewable generator shall then
post the collateral no later than 30 days after the commission issues an interim order finding
sufficient financial commitment by renewable generators for the CREZ. If the renewable
generators post sufficient collateral, the commission may enter a final order with findings
that reflect the adequacy of the financial commitment for the CREZ. If the renewable
generators do not post sufficient collateral, the commission may enter a final order with
findings that reflect the inadequacy of the financial commitments for the CREZ.
(B) A renewable generator shall post collateral equal to $15,350 per MW of its planned project
capacity, or $10,000 per MW if the capacity is supported by leasing agreements with
landowners that convey a right or option for a period of at least 20 years to develop and
operate a renewable energy project based on a conversion factor of 60 acres per MW for a
wind energy project.
(C) A renewable generator planning to build a project in a CREZ shall post collateral with the
TSP with which it will interconnect in the CREZ or, if the TSP with which it will
interconnect has not been determined, with any TSP that has been designated to build and
own transmission facilities for that CREZ.
(D) A renewable generator may post collateral by providing a cash deposit, letter of credit, or
guaranty agreement from an entity with an investment-grade credit rating. A TSP shall
require a renewable generator that posts a guaranty agreement to provide another form of
collateral if the guarantor loses its investment-grade credit rating or declares bankruptcy.
If the renewable generator does not provide another form of collateral, the commission
may take appropriate action including seeking administrative penalties.
(8) A TSP that receives collateral from a renewable generator pursuant to paragraph (7) of this
subsection shall handle that collateral in accordance with the following provisions.
(A) If a renewable generator signs an IA with the TSP and posts any collateral required by the
TSP to secure the construction of collection facilities, the TSP shall return to the generator
all collateral received from that generator.
(B) If a renewable generator does not sign an IA with the TSP and post any collateral required
by the TSP to secure the construction of collection facilities within 90 days after the TSP
notifies it that the transmission system is capable of accommodating the renewable
generator’s renewable energy facility, the TSP shall retain the collateral received from the
generator as an offset to the cost of the transmission facilities the TSP constructs for the
CREZ and shall take all reasonable measures to execute any non-cash collateral.
(9) In a CREZ CCN application, a TSP may propose modifications to the transmission facilities
described in a CREZ order if such improvements would reduce the cost of transmission or increase
the amount of generating capacity that transmission improvements for the CREZ can accommodate.
The commission may direct ERCOT to review modifications proposed by the TSP.

Effective 7/5/16
(10) Findings in Docket Numbers 33672, 35665, and 36146 and the commission’s finding in paragraph
(5) of this subsection establish that the level of financial commitment is sufficient under PURA
§39.904(g)(3) to grant CCNs for transmission facilities designated as a Default Project in ordering
paragraph 1 of the Order in Docket Number 36146 and for transmission facilities designated as a
Priority Project in finding of fact 136 in the Order on Rehearing in Docket Number 33672. This
finding of sufficient financial commitment shall be recognized in all pending and future CCN
proceedings for Default and Priority Projects and shall not be addressed further in those proceedings.
(f) Excess development in a CREZ. If the aggregate level of renewable energy capacity for which transmission
service is requested for a CREZ exceeds the maximum level of renewable capacity specified in the CREZ
order, and if the commission determines that the security constrained economic dispatch mechanism used in
the power region to establish a priority in the dispatch of CREZ resources is insufficient to resolve the
congestion caused by excess development, the commission may initiate a proceeding and may consider
limiting interconnection to and/or establishing dispatch priorities regarding the transmission system in the
CREZ, and identifying the developers whose projects may interconnect to the transmission system in the
CREZ under special protection schemes.

the algorithm, but typically requires some data associated with actual installed measure. An electric
utility may use the calculation with documented measure-specific assumptions, instead of energy
and peak demand savings determined through measurement and verification activities or the use of
deemed savings.
(8) Deemed savings value -- An estimate of energy or demand savings for a single unit of an installed
energy efficiency measure that has been developed from data sources and analytical methods that
are widely considered acceptable for the measure and purpose, and is applicable to the situation

(14) Energy efficiency measures -- Equipment, materials, and practices, including practices that result
in behavioral or operational changes, implemented at a customer’s site on the customer’s side of the
meter that result in a reduction at the customer level and/or on the utility’s system in electric energy
consumption, measured in kWh, or peak demand, measured in kW, or both. These measures may
include thermal energy storage and removal of an inefficient appliance so long as the customer need
satisfied by the appliance is still met.

determines the period of time over which the benefits of the energy efficiency measure are expected
to accrue.
(20) Evaluated savings -- Savings estimates reported by the EM&V contractor after the energy
efficiency activities and an impact evaluation have been completed. Differs from claimed savings
in that the EM&V contractor has conducted some of the evaluation and/or verification activities.
These values may rely on claimed savings for factors such as installation rates and the Technical
Reference Manual for values such as per unit savings values and operating hours. These savings
estimates may also include adjustments to claimed savings for data errors, per unit savings values,
operating hours, installation rates, savings persistence rates, or other considerations. Can be
indicated as first year, annual demand or energy savings, and/or lifetime energy or demand savings
values. Can be indicated as gross savings and/or net savings values.

(46) Peak period -- For the purpose of this section, the peak period consists of the hours from one p.m.
to seven p.m. during the months of June, July, August, and September, and the hours of six a.m. to
ten a.m. and six p.m. to ten p.m. during the months of December, January, and February, excluding
weekends and Federal holidays.
(47) Program year -- A year in which an energy efficiency incentive program is implemented, beginning
January 1 and ending December 31.
(48) Projected savings -- Values reported by an electric utility prior to the time the energy efficiency
activities are implemented. Are typically estimates of savings prepared for program and/or portfolio
design or planning purposes. These values are based on pre-program or portfolio estimates of
factors such as per-unit savings values, operating hours, installation rates, and savings persistence
rates. These values may utilize results of prior evaluations and/or values in the Technical Reference
Manual. Can be indicated as first year, annual demand or energy savings, and/or lifetime energy or
demand savings values. Can be indicated as gross savings and/or net savings values.
(49) Renewable demand side management (DSM) technologies -- Equipment that uses a renewable
energy resource (renewable resource), as defined in §25.173(c) of this title (relating to Renewable
Energy Credit Program), a geothermal heat pump, a solar water heater, or another natural
mechanism of the environment, that when installed at a customer site, reduces the customer’s net
purchases of energy, demand, or both.
(50) Savings-to-Investment Ratio (SIR) -- The ratio of the present value of a customer’s estimated
lifetime electricity cost savings from energy efficiency measures to the present value of the
installation costs, inclusive of any incidental repairs, of those energy efficiency measures.
(51) Self-delivered program -- A program developed by a utility in an area in which customer choice
is not offered that provides incentives directly to customers. The utility may use internal or external
resources to design and administer the program.
(52) Spillover -- Reductions in energy consumption and/or demand caused by the presence of an energy
efficiency program, beyond the program-related gross savings of the participants and without
financial or technical assistance from the program. There can be participant and/or non-participant
spillover.
(53) Spillover rate -- Estimate of energy savings attributable to spillover expressed as a percent of
savings installed by participants through an energy efficiency program.
(54) Standard offer contract -- A contract between an energy efficiency service provider and a
participating utility or between a participating utility and a commercial customer specifying standard
payments based upon the amount of energy and peak demand savings achieved through energy
efficiency measures, the measurement and verification protocols, and other terms and conditions,
consistent with this section.
(55) Standard offer program -- A program under which a utility administers standard offer contracts
between the utility and energy efficiency service providers.
(56) Technical reference manual (TRM) -- A resource document compiled by the commission’s
EM&V contractor that includes information used in program planning and reporting of energy
efficiency programs. It can include savings values for measures, engineering algorithms to calculate
savings, impact factors to be applied to calculated savings (e.g., net-to-gross values), protocols,
source documentation, specified assumptions, and other relevant material to support the calculation
of measure and program savings.
(57) Verification -- An independent assessment that a program has been implemented in accordance
with the program design. The objectives of measure installation verification are to confirm the
installation rate, that the installation meets reasonable quality standards, and that the measures are
operating correctly and have the potential to generate the predicted savings. Verification activities
are generally conducted during on-site surveys of a sample of projects. Project site inspections,
participant phone and mail surveys and/or implementer and participant documentation review are
typical activities associated with verification. Verification is also a subset of evaluation.

(P 48692)
(d) Cost-effectiveness standard. An energy efficiency program is deemed to be cost-effective if the cost of the
program to the utility is less than or equal to the benefits of the program. Utilities are encouraged to achieve
demand reduction and energy savings through a portfolio of cost-effective programs that exceed each utility’s
energy efficiency goals while staying within the cost caps established in §25.182(d)(7) of this title.
(1) The cost of a program includes the cost of incentives, EM&V contractor costs, any shareholder
bonus awarded to the utility, and actual or allocated research and development and administrative
costs. The benefits of the program consist of the value of the demand reductions and energy savings,
measured in accordance with the avoided costs prescribed in this subsection. The present value of
the program benefits shall be calculated over the projected life of the measures installed or
implemented under the program.
(2) The avoided cost of capacity shall be established in accordance with this paragraph.
(A) By November 1 of each year, commission staff shall file the avoided cost of capacity for
the upcoming year, including supporting data, in the commission’s central records under
the control number for the energy efficiency implementation project.
(i) Staff shall calculate the avoided cost of capacity from the base overnight cost
using the lower of a new conventional combustion turbine or a new advanced
combustion turbine, as reported by the United States Department of Energy’s
Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Cost and Performance
Characteristics of New Central Station Electricity Generating Technologies
associated with EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook. If EIA cost data that reflects
current conditions in the industry does not exist, staff may establish an avoided
cost of capacity using another data source.
(ii) If the EIA base overnight cost of a new conventional or an advanced combustion
turbine, whichever is lower, is less than $700 per kW, the avoided cost of capacity
shall be $80 per kW-year. If the base overnight cost of a new conventional or
advanced combustion turbine, whichever is lower, is at or between $700 and
$1,000 per kW, the avoided cost of capacity shall be $100 per kW-year. If the
base overnight cost of a new conventional or advanced combustion turbine,
whichever is lower, is greater than $1,000 per kW, the avoided cost of capacity
shall be $120 per kW-year.
(iii) The avoided cost of capacity calculated by staff may be challenged only by the
filing of a petition within 45 days of the date the avoided cost of capacity is filed
in the commission’s central records under the control number for the energy
efficiency implementation project described by paragraph (2)(A) of this
subsection. The petition must clearly describe the reasons commission’s staff’s
avoided cost calculation is incorrect, include supporting data and calculations, and
state the relief sought.
(B) A utility in an area in which customer choice is not offered may petition the commission
for authorization to use an avoided cost of capacity different from the avoided cost
determined according to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by filing a petition no later
than 45 days after the date the avoided cost of capacity calculated by staff is filed in the
commission’s central records under the control number for the energy efficiency
implementation project described by paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection. The petition must
clearly describe the reasons a different avoided cost should be used, include supporting
data and calculations, and state the relief sought. The avoided cost of capacity proposed
by the utility shall be based on a generating resource or purchase in the utility’s resource
acquisition plan and the terms of the purchase or the cost of the resource shall be disclosed
in the filing.
(3) The avoided cost of energy shall be established in accordance with this paragraph.
(A) By November 1 of each year, ERCOT shall file the avoided cost of energy for the upcoming
year for the ERCOT region, as defined in §25.5(48) of this title (relating to Definitions), in the
commission’s central records under the control number for the energy efficiency
implementation project. ERCOT shall calculate the avoided cost of energy by determining
the load-weighted average of the competitive load zone settlement point prices for the peak 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
periods covering the two previous winter and summer peaks. The avoided cost of energy
calculated by ERCOT may be challenged only by the filing of a petition within 45 days of
the date the avoided cost of capacity is filed by ERCOT in the commission’s central records
under the control number for the energy efficiency implementation project described by
paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection. The petition must clearly describe the reasons
ERCOT’s avoided cost of energy calculation is incorrect, include supporting data and
calculations, and state the relief sought.
(B) A utility in an area in which customer choice is not offered may petition the commission
for authorization to use an avoided cost of energy other than that otherwise determined
according to this paragraph. The avoided cost of energy may be based on peak period
energy prices in an energy market operated by a regional transmission organization if the
utility participates in that market and the prices are reported publicly. If the utility does not
participate in such a market, the avoided cost of energy may be based on the expected heat
rate of the gas-turbine generating technology specified in this subsection, multiplied by a
publicly reported cost of natural gas.
(e) Annual energy efficiency goals.
(1) An electric utility shall administer a portfolio of energy efficiency programs to acquire, at a
minimum, the following:
(A) Beginning with the 2013 program year, until the trigger described in subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph is reached, the utility shall acquire a 30% reduction of its annual growth in
demand of residential and commercial customers.
(B) If the demand reduction goal to be acquired by a utility under subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph is equivalent to at least four-tenths of 1% of its summer weather-adjusted peak
demand for the combined residential and commercial customers for the previous program
year, the utility shall meet the energy efficiency goal described in subparagraph (C) of this
paragraph for each subsequent program year.
(C) Once the trigger described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is reached, the utility shall
acquire four-tenths of 1% of its summer weather-adjusted peak demand for the combined
residential and commercial customers for the previous program year.
(D) Except as adjusted in accordance with subsection (u) of this section, a utility’s demand
reduction goal in any year shall not be lower than its goal for the prior year, unless the
commission establishes a goal for a utility under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(2) The commission may establish for a utility a lower goal than the goal specified in paragraph (1) of
this subsection, a higher administrative spending cap than the cap specified under subsection (g) of
this section, or an EECRF greater than the cap specified in §25.182(d)(7) of this title if the utility
demonstrates that compliance with that goal, administrative spending cap, or EECRF cost cap is not
reasonably possible and that good cause supports the lower goal, higher administrative spending
cap, or higher EECRF cost cap. To be eligible for a lower goal, higher administrative spending cap,
or a higher EECRF cost cap, the utility must request a good cause exception as part of its EECRF
application under §25.182 of this title. If approved, the good cause exception is limited to the
program year associated with the EECRF application.
(3) Each utility’s demand-reduction goal shall be calculated as follows:
(A) Each year’s historical demand for residential and commercial customers shall be adjusted
for weather fluctuations, using weather data for the most recent ten years. The utility’s
growth in residential and commercial demand is based on the average growth in retail load
in the Texas portion of the utility’s service area, measured at the utility’s annual system
peak. The utility shall calculate the average growth rate for the prior five years.
(B) The demand goal for energy-efficiency savings for a year under paragraph (1)(A) of this
subsection is calculated by applying the percentage goal to the average growth in peak
demand, calculated in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. The annual
demand goal for energy efficiency savings under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection is
calculated by applying the percentage goal to the utility’s summer weather-adjusted fiveyear average peak demand for the combined residential and commercial customers. This 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
annual peak demand goal at the source is then converted to an equivalent goal at the meter
by applying reasonable line loss factors.
(C) A utility may submit for commission approval an alternative method to calculate its growth
in demand, for good cause.
(D) If a utility’s prior five-year average load growth, calculated under subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph, is negative, the utility shall use the demand reduction goal calculated using the
alternative method approved by the commission beginning with the 2013 program year or,
if the commission has not approved an alternative method, the utility shall use the previous
year’s demand reduction goal.
(E) A utility shall not claim savings obtained from energy efficiency measures funded through
settlement orders or count towards the bonus calculation any savings obtained from grant
incentives that have been awarded directly to the utility for energy efficiency programs.
(F) Savings achieved through programs for hard-to-reach customers shall be no less than 5.0%
of the utility’s total demand reduction goal.
(G) Utilities may apply peak savings on a per project basis to summer or winter peak, but not
to both summer and winter peaks.
(4) An electric utility shall administer a portfolio of energy efficiency programs designed to meet an
energy savings goal calculated from its demand savings goal, using a 20% conservation load factor.
(5) Electric utilities shall administer a portfolio of energy efficiency programs to effectively and
efficiently achieve the goals set out in this section.
(A) Incentive payments may be made under standard offer contracts, market transformation
contracts, or as part of a self-delivered program for energy savings and demand reductions.
Each electric utility shall establish standard incentive payments to achieve the objectives
of this section.
(B) Projects or measures under a standard offer, market transformation, or self-delivered
program are not eligible for incentive payments or compensation if:
(i) A project would achieve demand or energy reduction by eliminating an existing
function, shutting down a facility or operation, or would result in building
vacancies or the re-location of existing operations to a location outside of the area
served by the utility conducting the program, except for an appliance recycling
program consistent with this section.
(ii) A measure would be adopted even in the absence of the energy efficiency service
provider’s proposed energy efficiency project, except in special cases, such as
hard-to-reach and weatherization programs, or where free riders are accounted for
using a net to gross adjustment of the avoided costs, or another method that
achieves the same result.
(iii) A project results in negative environmental or health effects, including effects that
result from improper disposal of equipment and materials.
(C) Ineligibility under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph does not apply to standard offer,
market transformation, and self-delivered programs aimed at energy code adoption,
implementation, compliance, and enforcement under subsection (k) of this section, nor
does it preclude standard offer, market transformation, or self-delivered programs
promoting energy efficiency measures also required by energy codes to the degree such
codes do not achieve full compliance rates.
(D) A utility in an area in which customer choice is not offered may achieve the goals of
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection by:
(i) providing rebate or incentive funds directly to eligible residential and commercial
customers for programs implemented under this section; or
(ii) developing, subject to commission approval, new programs other than standard
offer programs and market transformation programs, to the extent that the new
programs satisfy the same cost-effectiveness standard as standard offer programs
and market transformation programs using the process outlined in subsection (q)
of this section.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
(E) For a utility in an area in which customer choice is offered, the utility may achieve the goal
of this section in rural areas by providing rebate or incentive funds directly to customers
after demonstrating to the commission in a contested case hearing that the goal requirement
cannot be met through the implementation of programs by retail electric providers or
energy efficiency service providers in the rural areas.
(f) Incentive payments. The incentive payments for each customer class shall not exceed 100% of avoided
cost, as determined in accordance with this section. The incentive payments shall be set by each utility with
the objective of achieving its energy and demand savings goals at the lowest reasonable cost per program.
Different incentive levels may be established for areas that have historically been underserved by the utility’s
energy efficiency programs or for other appropriate reasons. Utilities may adjust incentive payments during
the program year, but such adjustments must be clearly publicized in the materials used by the utility to set
out the program rules and describe the programs to participating energy efficiency service providers.
(g) Utility administration. The cost of administration in a program year shall not exceed 15% of a utility’s total
program costs for that program year. The cost of research and development in a program year shall not
exceed 10% of a utility’s total program costs for that program year. The cumulative cost of administration
and research and development shall not exceed 20% of a utility’s total program costs, unless a good cause
exception filed under subsection (e)(2) of this section is granted. Any portion of these costs that is not directly
assignable to a specific program shall be allocated among the programs in proportion to the program incentive
costs. Any bonus awarded by the commission shall not be included in program costs for the purpose of
applying these limits.
(1) Administrative costs include all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by a utility in carrying out
its responsibilities under this section, including:
(A) conducting informational activities designed to explain the standard offer programs and
market transformation programs to energy efficiency service providers, retail electric
providers, and vendors;
(B) for a utility offering self-delivered programs, internal utility costs to conduct outreach
activities to customers and energy efficiency service providers will be considered
administration;
(C) providing informational programs to improve customer awareness of energy efficiency
programs and measures;
(D) reviewing and selecting energy efficiency programs in accordance with this section;
(E) providing regular and special reports to the commission, including reports of energy and
demand savings;
(F) a utility’s costs for an EECRF proceeding conducted under §25.182(d) of this title;
(G) the costs paid by a utility pursuant to PURA §33.023(b) for an EECRF proceeding
conducted under §25.182(d) of this title; however, these costs are not included in the
administrative caps applied in this paragraph; and
(H) any other activities that are necessary and appropriate for successful program
implementation.
(2) A utility shall adopt measures to foster competition among energy efficiency service providers for
standard offer, market transformation, and self-delivered programs, such as limiting the number of
projects or level of incentives that a single energy efficiency service provider and its affiliates is
eligible for and establishing funding set-asides for small projects.
(3) A utility may establish funding set-asides or other program rules to foster participation in energy
efficiency programs by municipalities and other governmental entities.
(4) Electric utilities offering standard offer, market transformation, and self-delivered programs shall
use standardized forms, procedures, and program templates. The electric utility shall file any
standardized materials, or any change to it, with the commission at least 60 days prior to its use. In
filing such materials, the utility shall provide an explanation of changes from the version of the
materials that was previously used. For standard offer, market transformation, and self-delivered
programs, the utility shall provide relevant documents to retail electric providers and energy
efficiency service providers and work collaboratively with them when it changes program 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
documents, to the extent that such changes are not considered in the energy efficiency
implementation project described in subsection (q) of this section.
(5) Each electric utility in an area in which customer choice is offered shall conduct programs to
encourage and facilitate the participation of retail electric providers and energy efficiency service
providers in the delivery of efficiency and demand response programs, including:
(A) Coordinating program rules, contracts, and incentives to facilitate the statewide marketing
and delivery of the same or similar programs by retail electric providers;
(B) Setting aside amounts for programs to be delivered to customers by retail electric providers
and establishing program rules and schedules that will give retail electric providers
sufficient time to plan, advertise, and conduct energy efficiency programs, while
preserving the utility’s ability to meet the goals in this section; and
(C) Working with retail electric providers and energy efficiency service providers to evaluate
the demand reductions and energy savings resulting from time-of-use prices; home-area
network devices, such as in-home displays; and other programs facilitated by advanced
meters to determine the demand and energy savings from such programs.
(h) Standard offer programs. A utility’s standard offer program shall be implemented through program rules
and standard offer contracts that are consistent with this section. Standard offer contracts will be available
to any energy efficiency service provider that satisfies the contract requirements prescribed by the utility
under this section and demonstrates that it is capable of managing energy efficiency projects under an electric
utility’s energy efficiency program.
(i) Market transformation programs. Market transformation programs are strategic efforts, including, but not
limited to, incentives and education designed to reduce market barriers for energy efficient technologies and
practices. Market transformation programs may be designed to obtain energy savings or peak demand
reductions beyond savings that are reasonably expected to be achieved as a result of current compliance levels
with existing building codes applicable to new buildings and equipment efficiency standards or standard offer
programs. Market transformation programs may also be specifically designed to express support for early
adoption, implementation, and enforcement of the most recent version of the International Energy
Conservation Code for residential or commercial buildings by local jurisdictions, express support for more
effective implementation and enforcement of the state energy code and compliance with the state energy
code, and encourage utilization of the types of building components, products, and services required to
comply with such energy codes. The existence of federal, state, or local governmental funding for, or
encouragement to utilize, the types of building components, products, and services required to comply with
such energy codes does not prevent utilities from offering programs to supplement governmental spending
and encouragement. Utilities should cooperate with the retail electric providers, and, where possible,
leverage existing industry-recognized programs that have the potential to reduce demand and energy
consumption in Texas and consider statewide administration where appropriate. Market transformation
programs may operate over a period of more than one year and may demonstrate cost-effectiveness over a
period longer than one year.
(j) Self-delivered programs. A utility may use internal or external resources to design, administer, and deliver
self-delivered programs. The programs shall be tailored to the unique characteristics of the utility’s service
area in order to attract customer and energy efficiency service provider participation. The programs shall
meet the same cost effectiveness requirements as standard offer and market transformation programs.
(k) Requirements for standard offer, market transformation, and self-delivered programs. A utility’s
standard offer, market transformation, and self-delivered programs shall meet the requirements of this
subsection. A utility may conduct information and advertising campaigns to foster participation in standard
offer, market transformation, and self-delivered programs.
(1) Standard offer, market transformation, and self-delivered programs:
(A) shall describe the eligible customer classes and allocate funding among the classes on an
equitable basis;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
(B) may offer standard incentive payments and specify a schedule of payments that are
sufficient to meet the goals of the program, which shall be consistent with this section, or
any revised payment formula adopted by the commission. The incentive payments may
include both payments for energy and demand savings, as appropriate;
(C) shall not permit the provision of any product, service, pricing benefit, or alternative terms
or conditions to be conditioned upon the purchase of any other good or service from the
utility, except that only customers taking transmission and distribution services from a
utility can participate in its energy efficiency programs;
(D) shall provide for a complaint process that allows:
(i) an energy efficiency service provider to file a complaint with the commission
against a utility; and
(ii) a customer to file a complaint with the utility against an energy efficiency service
provider;
(E) may permit the use of distributed renewable generation, geothermal, heat pump, solar water
heater and combined heat and power technologies, involving installations of ten megawatts
or less;
(F) may factor in the estimated level of enforcement and compliance with existing energy
codes in determining energy and peak demand savings; and
(G) may require energy efficiency service providers to provide the following:
(i) a description of how the value of any incentive will be passed on to customers;
(ii) evidence of experience and good credit rating;
(iii) a list of references;
(iv) all applicable licenses required under state law and local building codes;
(v) evidence of all building permits required by governing jurisdictions; and
(vi) evidence of all necessary insurance.
(2) Standard offer and self-delivered programs:
(A) shall require energy efficiency service providers to identify peak demand and energy
savings for each project in the proposals they submit to the utility;
(B) shall be neutral with respect to specific technologies, equipment, or fuels. Energy
efficiency projects may lead to switching from electricity to another energy source,
provided that the energy efficiency project results in overall lower energy costs, lower
energy consumption, and the installation of high efficiency equipment. Utilities may not
pay incentives for a customer to switch from gas appliances to electric appliances except
in connection with the installation of high efficiency combined heating and air conditioning
systems;
(C) shall require that all projects result in a reduction in purchased energy consumption, or
peak demand, or a reduction in energy costs for the end-use customer;
(D) shall encourage comprehensive projects incorporating more than one energy efficiency
measure;
(E) shall be limited to projects that result in consistent and predictable energy or peak demand
savings over an appropriate period of time based on the life of the measure; and
(F) may permit a utility to use poor performance, including customer complaints, as a criterion
to limit or disqualify an energy efficiency service provider or its affiliate from participating
in a program.
(3) A market transformation program shall identify:
(A) program goals;
(B) market barriers the program is designed to overcome;
(C) key intervention strategies for overcoming those barriers;
(D) estimated costs and projected energy and capacity savings;
(E) a baseline study that is appropriate in time and geographic region. In establishing a
baseline, the study shall consider the level of regional implementation and enforcement of
any applicable energy code;
(F) program implementation timeline and milestones;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
(G) a description of how the program will achieve the transition from extensive market
intervention activities toward a largely self-sustaining market;
(H) a method for measuring and verifying savings; and
(I) the period over which savings shall be considered to accrue, including a projected date by
which the market will be sufficiently transformed so that the program should be
discontinued.
(4) A market transformation program shall be designed to achieve energy or peak demand savings, or
both, and lasting changes in the way energy efficient goods or services are distributed, purchased,
installed, or used over a defined period of time. A utility shall use fair competitive procedures to
select energy efficiency service providers to conduct a market transformation program, and shall
include in its annual report the justification for the selection of an energy efficiency service provider
to conduct a market transformation program on a sole-source basis.
(5) A load-control standard-offer program shall not permit an energy efficiency service provider to
receive incentives under the program for the same demand reduction benefit for which it is
compensated under a capacity-based demand response program conducted by an independent
organization, independent system operator, or regional transmission operator. The qualified
scheduling entity representing an energy efficiency service provider is not prohibited from receiving
revenues from energy sold in ERCOT markets in addition to any incentive for demand reduction
offered under a utility load-control standard offer program.
(6) Utilities offering load management programs shall work with ERCOT and energy efficiency
service providers to identify eligible loads and shall integrate such loads into the ERCOT markets
to the extent feasible. Such integration shall not preclude the continued operation of utility load
management programs that cannot be feasibly integrated into the ERCOT markets or that
continue to provide separate and distinct benefits.
(l) Energy efficiency plans and reports (EEPR). Each electric utility shall file by April 1 of each year an
energy efficiency plan and report in a project annually designated for this purpose, as described in this
subsection and §25.183(d) of this title. The plan and report shall be filed as a searchable pdf document.
(1) Each electric utility’s energy efficiency plan and report shall describe how the utility intends to
achieve the goals set forth in this section and comply with the other requirements of this section.
The plan and report shall be based on program years. The plan and report shall propose an annual
budget sufficient to reach the goals specified in this section.
(2) Each electric utility’s plan and report shall include:
(A) the utility’s total actual and weather-adjusted peak demand and actual and weather-adjusted
peak demand for residential and commercial customers for the previous five years,
measured at the source;
(B) the demand goal calculated in accordance with this section for the current year and the
following year, including documentation of the demand, weather adjustments, and the
calculation of the goal;
(C) the utility’s customers’ total actual and weather-adjusted energy consumption and actual
and weather-adjusted energy consumption for residential and commercial customers for
the previous five years;
(D) the energy goal calculated in accordance with this section, including documentation of the

CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 4/4/19
(P 48692)
are achieved. A utility shall not provide an energy efficiency service provider final compensation until the
provider establishes that the work is complete and evaluation and/or measurement and verification in
accordance with the protocol verifies that the savings will be achieved. However, a utility may provide an
energy efficiency service provider that offers behavioral programs incremental compensation as work is
performed. If inspection of one or more measures is a part of the protocol, a utility shall not provide an
energy efficiency service provider final compensation until the utility has conducted its inspection on at least
a sample of measures and the inspections confirm that the work has been done. A utility shall provide
inspection reports to commission staff within 20 days of staff’s request.
(1) The energy efficiency service provider, or for self-delivered programs, the utility, is responsible for
the determination and documentation of energy and peak demand savings using the approved
evaluation and/or measurement and verification protocol, and may utilize the services of an
independent third party for such purposes.
(2) Commission-approved deemed energy and peak demand savings may be used in lieu of the energy
efficiency service provider’s measurement and verification, where applicable. The deemed savings
approved by the commission before December 31, 2007 are continued in effect, unless superseded
by commission action.
(3) Where installed measures are employed, an energy efficiency service provider shall verify that the
measures contracted for were installed before final payment is made to the energy efficiency service
provider, by obtaining the customer’s signature certifying that the measures were installed, or by
other reasonably reliable means approved by the utility.
(4) For projects involving over 30 installations, a statistically significant sample of installations will be
subject to on-site inspection in accordance with the protocol for the project to verify that measures
are installed and capable of performing their intended function. Inspection shall occur within 30
days of notification of measure installation.
(5) Projects of less than 30 installations may be aggregated and a statistically significant sample of the
aggregate installations will be subject to on-site inspection in accordance with the protocol for the
projects to ensure that measures are installed and capable of performing their intended function.
Inspection shall occur within 30 days of notification of measure installation.
(6) Where installed measures are employed, the sample size for on-site inspections may be adjusted for
an energy efficiency service provider under a particular contract, based on the results of prior
inspections.
(o) Evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V). The following defines the evaluation, measurement,
and verification (EM&V) framework. The goal of this framework is to ensure that the programs are
evaluated, measured, and verified using a consistent process that allows for accurate estimation of energy
and demand impacts.
(1) EM&V objectives include:
(A) Documenting the impacts of the utilities’ individual energy efficiency and load
management portfolios, comparing their performance with established goals, and
determining cost-effectiveness;
(B) Providing feedback for the commission, commission staff, utilities, and other stakeholders
on program portfolio performance; and
(C) Providing input into the utilities’ and ERCOT’s planning activities.
(2) The principles that guide the EM&V activities in meeting the primary EM&V objectives are:
(A) Evaluators follow ethical guidelines.
(B) Important and relevant assumptions used by program planners and administrators are
reviewed as part of the EM&V efforts.
(C) All important and relevant EM&V assumptions and calculations are documented and the
reliability of results is indicated in evaluation reports.
(D) The majority of evaluation expenditures and efforts are in areas of greatest importance or
uncertainty.
(3) The commission shall select an entity to act as the commission’s EM&V contractor and conduct
evaluation activities. The EM&V contractor shall operate under the commission’s supervision and

oversight, and the EM&V contractor shall offer independent analysis to the commission in order to
assist in making decisions in the public interest.
(A) Under the oversight of the commission staff and with the assistance of utilities and other
parties, the EM&V contractor will evaluate specific programs and the portfolio of programs
for each utility.
(B) The EM&V contractor shall have the authority to request data it considers necessary to
fulfill its evaluation, measurements, and verification responsibilities from the utilities. A
utility shall make good faith efforts to provide complete, accurate, and timely responses to
all EM&V contractor requests for documents, data, information and other materials. The
commission may on its own volition or upon recommendation by staff require that a utility
provide the EM&V contractor with specific information.
(4) Evaluation activities will be conducted by the EM&V contractor to meet the evaluation objectives
defined in this section. Activities shall include, but are not limited to:
(A) Providing appropriate planning documents.
(B) Impact evaluations to determine and document appropriate metrics for each utility’s
individual evaluated programs and portfolio of all programs, annual portfolio evaluation
reports, and additional reports and services as defined by commission staff to meet the
EM&V objectives.
(C) Preparation of a statewide technical reference manual (TRM), including updates to such
manual as defined in this subsection.
(5) The impact evaluation activities may include the use of one or more evaluation approaches.
Evaluation activities may also include, or just include, verification activities on a census or sample
of projects implemented by the utilities. Evaluations may also include the use of due-diligence on
utility-provided documentation as well as surveys of program participants, non-participants,
contractors, vendors, and other market actors.
(6) The following apply to the development of a statewide TRM by the EM&V contractor.
(A) The EM&V contractor shall use existing Texas, or other state, deemed savings manual(s),
protocols, and the work papers used to develop the values in the manual(s), as a foundation
for developing the TRM. The TRM shall include applicability requirements for each
deemed savings value or deemed savings calculation. The TRM may also include
standardized EM&V protocols for determining and/or verifying energy and demand
savings for particular measures or programs. Utilities may apply TRM deemed savings
values or deemed savings calculations to a measure or program if the applicability criteria
are met.
(B) The TRM shall be reviewed by the EM&V contractor at least annually, under a schedule
determined by commission staff, with the intention of preparing an updated TRM, if
needed. In addition, any utility or other stakeholder may request additions to or
modifications to the TRM at any time with the provision of documentation for the basis of
such an addition or modification. At the discretion of commission staff, the EM&V
contractor may review such documentation to prepare a recommendation with respect to
the addition or modification.
(C) Commission staff shall approve any updated TRMs through the energy efficiency
implementation project. The approval process for any TRM additions or modifications,
not made during the regular review schedule determined by commission staff, shall include
a review by commission staff to determine if an addition or modification is appropriate
before an annual update. TRM changes approved by staff may be challenged only by the
filing of a petition within 45 days of the date that staff’s approval is filed in the
commission’s central records under the control number for the energy efficiency
implementation project described by subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section. The petition must
clearly describe the reasons commission staff should not have approved the TRM changes,
include supporting data and calculations, and state the relief sought.
(D) Any changes to the TRM shall be applied prospectively to programs offered in the
appropriate program year.
(E) The TRM shall be publicly available.

(F) Utilities shall utilize the values contained in the TRM, unless the commission indicates
otherwise.
(7) The utilities shall prepare projected savings estimates and claimed savings estimates. The utilities
shall conduct their own EM&V activities for purposes such as confirming any incentive payments
to customers or contractors and preparing documentation for internal and external reporting,
including providing documentation to the EM&V contractor. The EM&V contractor shall prepare
evaluated savings for preparation of its evaluation reports and a realization rate comparing evaluated
savings with projected savings estimates and/or claimed savings estimates.
(8) Baselines for preparation of TRM deemed savings values or deemed savings calculations or for
other evaluation activities shall be defined by the EM&V contractor and commission staff shall
review and approve them. When common practice baselines are defined for determining gross
energy and/or demand savings for a measure or program, common practice may be documented by
market studies. Baselines shall be defined by measure category as follows (deviations from these
specifications may be made with justification and approval of commission staff):
(A) Baseline is existing conditions for the estimated remaining lifetime of existing equipment
for early replacement of functional equipment still within its current useful life. Baseline
is applicable code, standard or common practice for remaining lifetime of the measure past
the estimated remaining lifetime of existing equipment;
(B) Baseline is applicable code, standard or common practice for replacement of functional
equipment beyond its current useful life;
(C) Baseline is applicable code, standard or common practice for unplanned replacements of
failed equipment; and
(D) Baseline is applicable code, standard or common practice for new construction or major
tenant improvements.
(9) Relevant recommendations of the EM&V contractor related to program design and reporting should
be addressed in the Energy Efficiency Implementation Project (EEIP) and considered for
implementation in future program years. The commission may require a utility to implement the
EM&V contractor’s recommendations in a future program year.
(10) The utilities shall be assigned the EM&V costs in proportion to their annual program costs and shall
pay the invoices approved by the commission. The commission shall at least biennially review the
EM&V contractor’s costs and establish a budget for its services sufficient to pay for those services
that it determines are economic and beneficial to be performed.
(A) The funding of the EM&V contractor shall be sufficient to ensure the selection of an
EM&V contractor in accordance with the scope of EM&V activities outlined in this
subsection.
(B) EM&V costs shall be itemized in the utilities’ annual reports to the commission as a
separate line item. The EM&V costs shall not count against the utility’s cost caps or
administration spending caps.
(11) For the purpose of analysis, the utility shall grant the EM&V contractor access to data maintained
in the utilities’ data tracking systems, including, but not limited to, the following proprietary
customer information: customer identifying information, individual customer contracts, and load
and usage data in accordance with §25.272(g)(1)(A) of this title (relating to Code of Conduct for
Electric Utilities and Their Affiliates). Such information shall be treated as confidential information.
(A) The utility shall maintain records for three years that include the date, time, and nature of
proprietary customer information released to the EM&V contractor.
(B) The EM&V contractor shall aggregate data in such a way as to protect customer, retail
electric provider, and energy efficiency service provider proprietary information in any
non-confidential reports or filings the EM&V contractor prepares.
(C) The EM&V contractor shall not utilize data provided or received under commission
authority for any purposes outside the authorized scope of work the EM&V contractor
performs for the commission.

(P 48692)
§25.182. Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Factor.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.905 and
establish:
(1) an energy efficiency cost recovery factor (EECRF) that enables an electric utility to timely recover
the reasonable costs of providing a portfolio of cost-effective energy efficiency programs that
complies with this section and §25.181 of this title (relating to Energy Efficiency Goal).
(2) an incentive to reward an electric utility that exceeds its demand and energy reduction goals under
the requirements of §25.181 of this title at a cost that does not exceed the cost caps established in
subsection (d)(7) of this section.
(b) Application. This section applies to electric utilities.
(c) Definitions. The definitions provided in §25.181(c) of this title shall also apply in this section. The following
terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meaning unless the context indicates otherwise:
(1) Billing determinants -- The measures of energy consumption or load used to calculate a customer’s
bill or to determine the aggregate revenue from rates from all customers.
(2) Rate class -- For the purpose of calculating EECRF rates, a utility’s rate classes are those retail rate
classes approved in the utility’s most recent base-rate proceeding, excluding non-eligible customers.
(d) Cost recovery. A utility shall establish an EECRF that complies with this subsection to timely recover the
reasonable costs of providing a portfolio of cost-effective energy efficiency programs under §25.181 of this
title.
(1) The EECRF shall be calculated based on the following:
(A) The utility’s forecasted annual energy efficiency program expenditures, the preceding
year’s over- or under-recovery including interest and municipal and utility EECRF
proceeding expenses, any performance bonus earned under subsection (e) of this section,
and evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) contractor costs allocated to the
utility by the commission for the preceding year under §25.181 of this title.
(B) For a utility that collects any amount of energy efficiency costs in its base rates, the
amounts described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in excess of the actual energy
efficiency revenues collected from base rates as described in paragraph (2) of this
subsection.
(2) The commission may approve an EECRF for each eligible rate class. The costs shall be directly
assigned to each rate class that received services under the programs to the maximum extent
reasonably possible. In its EECRF proceeding, a utility may request a good cause exception to
combine one or more rate classes, each containing fewer than 20 customers, with a similar rate class
that received services under the same energy efficiency programs in the preceding year. For each
rate class, the under- or over-recovery of the energy efficiency costs shall be the difference between
actual EECRF revenues and actual costs for that class that comply with paragraph (12) of this
subsection, including interest applied on such over- or under-recovery calculated by rate class and
compounded on an annual basis for a two-year period using the annual interest rates authorized by
the commission for over- and under-billing for the year in which the over- or under-recovery
occurred and the immediately subsequent year. Where a utility collects energy efficiency costs in
its base rates, actual energy efficiency revenues collected from base rates consist of the amount of
energy efficiency costs expressly included in base rates, adjusted to account for changes in billing
determinants from the test year billing determinants used to set rates in the last base rate proceeding.
(3) A proceeding conducted under this subsection is a ratemaking proceeding for purposes of PURA
§33.023 and §36.061. EECRF proceeding expenses shall be included in the EECRF calculated
under paragraph (1) of this subsection as follows:
(A) For a utility’s EECRF proceeding expenses, the utility may include only its expenses for
the immediately previous EECRF proceeding conducted under this subsection.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter H. ELECTRICAL PLANNING
DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 04/04/19
(P 48692)
(B) For municipalities’ EECRF proceeding expenses, the utility may include only expenses
paid or owed for the immediately previous EECRF proceeding conducted under this
subsection for services reimbursable under PURA §33.023(b).
(4) Base rates shall not be set to recover energy efficiency costs.
(5) If a utility recovers energy efficiency costs through base rates, the EECRF may be changed in a
general rate proceeding. If a utility is not recovering energy efficiency costs through base rates, the
EECRF may be adjusted only in an EECRF proceeding under this subsection.
(6) For residential customers and for non-residential rate classes whose base rates do not provide for
demand charges, the EECRF rates shall be designed to provide only for energy charges. For nonresidential rate classes whose base rates provide for demand charges, the EECRF rates shall provide
for energy charges or demand charges, but not both. Any EECRF demand charge shall not be billed
using a demand ratchet mechanism.
(7) The total EECRF costs outlined in paragraph (1) of this subsection, excluding EM&V costs,
excluding municipal EECRF proceeding expenses, and excluding any interest amounts applied to
over- or under-recoveries, shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in this paragraph unless a good
cause exception filed under §25.181(e)(2) of this title is granted.
(A) For residential customers for program year 2018, $0.001263 per kWh increased or
decreased by a rate equal to the 2016 calendar year’s percentage change in the South urban
consumer price index (CPI), as determined by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics; and
(B) For commercial customers for program year 2018, rates designed to recover revenues equal
to $0.000790 per kWh increased or decreased by a rate equal to the 2016 calendar year’s
percentage change in the South urban CPI, as determined by the Federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics times the aggregate of all eligible commercial customers’ kWh consumption.
(C) For the 2019 program year and thereafter, the residential and commercial cost caps shall
be calculated to be the prior period’s cost caps increased or decreased by a rate equal to the
most recently available calendar year’s percentage change in the South urban CPI, as
determined by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(8) Not later than May 1 of each year, a utility in an area in which customer choice is not offered shall
apply to adjust its EECRF effective January 1 of the following year. Not later than June 1 of each
year, a utility in an area in which customer choice is offered shall apply to adjust its EECRF effective
March 1 of the following year. If a utility is in an area in which customer choice is offered in some
but not all parts of its service area and files one energy efficiency plan and report covering all of its
service area, the utility shall apply to adjust the EECRF not later than May 1 of each year, with the
EECRF effective January 1 in the parts of its service area in which customer choice is not offered
and March 1 in the parts of its service area in which customer choice is offered.
(9) Upon a utility’s filing of an application to establish a new EECRF or adjust an EECRF, the presiding
officer shall set a procedural schedule that will enable the commission to issue a final order in the
proceeding required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph as follows:
(A) For a utility in an area in which customer choice is not offered, the presiding officer shall
set a procedural schedule that will enable the commission to issue a final order in the
proceeding prior to the January 1 effective date of the new or adjusted EECRF, except
where good cause supports a different procedural schedule.
(B) For a utility in an area in which customer choice is offered, the effective date of a new or
adjusted EECRF shall be March 1. The presiding officer shall set a procedural schedule
that will enable the utility to file an EECRF compliance tariff consistent with the final order
within ten days of the date of the final order. The procedural schedule shall also provide
that the compliance filing date will be at least 45 days before the effective date of March
1. In no event shall the effective date of any new or adjusted EECRF occur less than 45
days after the utility files a compliance tariff consistent with a final order approving the
new or adjusted EECRF. The utility shall serve notice of the approved rates and the
effective date of the approved rates by the working day after the utility files a compliance
tariff consistent with the final order approving the new or adjusted EECRF to retail electric
providers that are authorized by the registration agent to provide service in the utility’s
service area. Notice under this subparagraph may be served by email. The procedural 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS

DIVISION 2: ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER-OWNED RESOURCES
Effective 04/04/19
(P 48692)
schedule may be extended for good cause, but in no event shall the effective date of any
new or adjusted EECRF occur less than 45 days after the utility files a compliance tariff
consistent with a final order approving the new or adjusted EECRF, and in no event shall
the utility serve notice of the approved rates and the effective date of the approved rates to
retail electric providers that are authorized by the registration agent to provide service in
the utility’s service area more than one working day after the utility files the compliance
tariff.
(C) For a utility in an area in which customer choice is offered in some but not all parts of its
service area and that files one energy efficiency plan and report covering all of its service
area, the presiding officer shall set a procedural schedule that will enable the commission
to issue a final order in the proceeding prior to the January 1 effective date of the new or
adjusted EECRF for the areas in which customer choice is not offered, except where good
cause supports a different schedule. For areas in which customer choice is offered, the
effective date of the new or adjusted EECRF shall be March 1. The presiding officer shall
set a procedural schedule that will enable the utility to file an EECRF compliance tariff
consistent with the final order within ten days of the date of the final order. The procedural
schedule shall also provide that the compliance filing date will be at least 45 days before
the effective date of March 1. In no event shall the effective date of any new or adjusted
EECRF occur less than 45 days after the utility files a compliance tariff consistent with a

Subchapter I. TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
DIVISION 1: OPEN-ACCESS COMPARABLE TRANSMISSION SERVICE FOR ELECTRIC
UTILITIES IN THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY COUNCIL OF TEXAS
Effective 6/20/01
§25.191. Transmission Service Requirements.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of Subchapter I, Division 1 of this chapter (relating to Transmission and Distribution),
is to clearly state the terms and conditions that govern transmission access in order to:
(1) facilitate competition in the sale of electric energy in Texas;
(2) preserve the reliability of electric service; and
(3) enhance economic efficiency in the production and consumption of electricity.
(b) Applicability. Unless otherwise explicitly provided, Division 1 of this subchapter (relating to Open-Access
Comparable Transmission Service for Electric Utilities in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas) applies
to transmission service providers (TSPs), as defined in §25.5 of this title (relating to Definitions), which
include river authorities and other electric utilities, municipally-owned utilities, and electric cooperatives.
The transmission service standards described in Division 1 of this subchapter also apply to transmission
service to, from, and over the direct-current interconnections between the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas (ERCOT) region and areas outside of the ERCOT region (DC ties), to the extent that tariffs for such
service incorporating the terms of Division 1 of this subchapter are approved for the transmission providers
that own an interest in the interconnections. Some provisions of Division 1 explicitly apply to distribution
service providers (DSPs), as defined in §25.5 of this title.
(c) Nature of transmission service. Transmission service allows for power delivery from generation resources
to serve loads, inside and outside of the ERCOT region. Service provided pursuant to Division 1 of this
subchapter permits municipally-owned utilities, electric cooperatives, power marketers, power generation
companies, qualifying scheduling entities, retail electric providers (REPs), qualifying facilities, and
distribution service providers (DSPs) to use the transmission systems of the TSPs in ERCOT. Transmission
service shall be provided pursuant to Division 1 of this subchapter, commission-approved tariffs, the ERCOT
protocols and, for TSPs subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction, FERC
requirements. Transmission service under Division 1 of this subchapter includes the provision of
transmission service to an entity that is scheduling the export or import of power from the ERCOT region
across a DC tie. The rules in Division 1 of this subchapter do not require a municipally owned utility or
electric cooperative that has not opted for customer choice to provide transmission service to a retail electric
provider or retail customer in connection with the retail sale of electricity in its exclusive service area.
(d) Obligation to provide transmission service. Each TSP in ERCOT shall provide transmission service in
accordance with the provisions of Division 1 of this subchapter.
(1) Where a TSP has contracted for another person to operate its transmission facilities, the person
assigned to operate the facilities shall carry out the operating responsibilities of the TSP under Division
1 of this subchapter.
(2) The obligation to provide comparable transmission service applies to a TSP, even if the TSP’s
interconnection with the transmission service customer is through distribution, rather than
transmission facilities. An electric cooperative that has not opted for customer choice or a municipally
owned utility that has not opted for customer choice shall provide wholesale transmission service at
distribution voltage when necessary to serve a wholesale customer.
(A) A TSP or a DSP that owns facilities for the delivery of electricity to a transmission service
customer purchasing electricity at wholesale using facilities rated at less than 60 kilovolts shall
provide the customer access to its facilities on a non-discriminatory basis.
(B) A TSP or DSP shall provide access to its facilities at the distribution level to a transmission
service customer, in order to transmit power to a retail customer in an area in which the
transmission service customer has the right to provide retail electric service. Such service shall
be provided on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with PURA §39.203(h).

level voltage if:
(i) The DSP is currently providing wholesale transmission service at distribution voltage;
or
(ii) The DSP receives a valid request to provide wholesale transmission service at
distribution voltage. The DSP shall file the tariff within 30 days of receiving the request.
(3) A TSP shall interconnect its facilities with new generating sources and construct facilities needed for
such an interconnection, in accordance with Division 1 of this subchapter. A TSP shall use all
reasonable efforts to communicate promptly with a power generation company to resolve any
questions regarding the requests for service in a non-discriminatory manner. If a TSP or a power
generation company is required to complete activities or to negotiate agreements as a condition of
service, each party shall use due diligence to complete these actions within a reasonable time.

§25.192. Transmission Service Rates.
(a) Tariffs. Each transmission service provider (TSP) shall file a tariff for transmission service to establish its
rates and other terms and conditions and shall apply its tariffs and rates on a non-discriminatory basis. The
tariff shall apply to all distribution service providers (DSPs) and any entity scheduling the export of power
from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region. The tariff shall not apply to any entity
engaging in wholesale storage as described by §25.501(m) of this title (relating to Wholesale Market Design
for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas) (storage entity).
(b) Charges for transmission service delivered within ERCOT. DSPs, excluding storage entities, shall incur
transmission service charges pursuant to the tariffs of the TSP.
(1) A TSP’s transmission rate shall be calculated as its commission-approved transmission cost of
service divided by the average of ERCOT coincident peak demand for the months of June, July,
August and September (4CP), excluding the portion of coincident peak demand attributable to
wholesale storage load. A TSP’s transmission rate shall remain in effect until the commission
approves a new rate. The TSP’s annual rate shall be converted to a monthly rate. The monthly
transmission service charge to be paid by each DSP is the product of each TSP’s monthly rate as
specified in its tariff and the DSP’s previous year’s average of the 4CP demand that is coincident
with the ERCOT 4CP.
(2) Payments for transmission services shall be consistent with commission orders, approved tariffs,
and §25.202 of this title (relating to Commercial Terms for Transmission Service).
(c) Transmission cost of service. The transmission cost of service for each TSP shall be based on the expenses
in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) expense accounts 560-573 (or accounts with similar
contents or amounts functionalized to the transmission function) plus the depreciation, federal income tax,
and other associated taxes, and the commission-allowed rate of return based on FERC plant accounts 350-
359 (or accounts with similar contents or amounts functionalized to the transmission function), less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred federal income taxes, as applicable.
(1) The following facilities are deemed to be transmission facilities:
(A) power lines, substations, reactive devices, and associated facilities, operated at 60 kilovolts
or above, including radial lines operated at or above 60 kilovolts, except the step-up
transformers and a protective device associated with the interconnection from a generating
station to the transmission network;
(B) substation facilities on the high side of the transformer, in a substation where power is
transformed from a voltage higher than 60 kilovolts to a voltage lower than 60 kilovolts;
(C) the portion of the direct-current interconnections with areas outside of the ERCOT region
(DC ties) that are owned by a TSP in the ERCOT region, including those portions of the
DC tie that operate at a voltage lower than 60 kilovolts; and
(D) capacitors and other reactive devices that are operated at a voltage below 60 kilovolts, if
they are located in a distribution substation, the load at the substation has a power factor in
excess of 0.95 as measured or calculated at the distribution voltage level without the
reactive devices, and the reactive devices are controlled by an operator or automatically
switched in response to transmission voltage.
(E) As used in subparagraphs (A) - (D) of this paragraph, reactive devices do not include
generating facilities.
(2) For municipally owned utilities, river authorities, and electric cooperatives, the commission may
permit the use of the cash flow method or other reasonable alternative methods of determining the
annual transmission revenue requirement, including the return element of the revenue requirement,
consistent with the rate actions of the rate-setting authority for a municipally owned utility.

Subchapter I. TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
DIVISION 1: OPEN-ACCESS COMPARABLE TRANSMISSION SERVICE FOR ELECTRIC
UTILITIES IN THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY COUNCIL OF TEXAS
Effective 12/20/2022
(P 53169)
(3) For municipally owned utilities, river authorities, and electric cooperatives, the return may be
determined based on the TSP’s actual debt service and a reasonable coverage ratio. In determining
a reasonable coverage ratio, the commission will consider the coverage ratios required in the TSP’s
bond indentures or ordinances and the most recent rate action of the rate-setting authority for the
TSP.
(4) A municipally owned utility that is required to apply for a certificate of public convenience and
necessity to construct, install, or extend a transmission facility within ERCOT pursuant to §25.101
of this title (relating to Certification Criteria) is entitled to recover, through the utility’s wholesale
transmission rate, reasonable payments made to a taxing entity in lieu of ad valorem taxes on that
transmission facility, provided that:
(A) The utility enters into a written agreement with the governing body of the taxing entity
related to the payments;
(B) The amount paid is the same as the amount the utility would have to pay to the taxing entity
on that transmission facility if the facility were subject to ad valorem taxation;
(C) The governing body of the taxing entity is not the governing body of the utility; and
(D) The utility provides the commission with a copy of the written agreement and any other
information that the commission considers necessary in relation to the agreement.
(5) The commission may adopt rate-filing requirements that provide additional details concerning the
costs that may be included in the transmission costs and how such costs should be reported in a
proceeding to establish transmission rates.
(d) Billing units. No later than December 1 of each year, ERCOT shall determine and file with the commission
the current year’s average 4CP demand for each DSP, or the DSP’s agent for transmission service billing
purposes, as appropriate, excluding the portion of coincident peak demand attributable to wholesale storage
load. This demand shall be used to bill transmission service for the next year. The ERCOT average 4CP
demand shall be the sum of the coincident peak of all of the ERCOT DSPs, excluding the portion of
coincident peak demand attributable to wholesale storage load, for the four intervals coincident with ERCOT
system peak for the months of June, July, August, and September, divided by four. As used in this section,
a DSP’s average 4CP demand is determined from the total demand, coincident with the ERCOT 4CP, of all
customers connected to a DSP, including load served at transmission voltage, but excluding the load of
wholesale storage entities. The measurement of the coincident peak shall be in accordance with commissionapproved ERCOT protocols.
(e) Transmission rates for exports from ERCOT. A transmission service charge for exports of power from
ERCOT must be assessed to transmission service customers for transmission service within the boundaries
of the ERCOT region, in accordance with this section and the ERCOT protocols.
(1) A transmission service customer must be assessed a transmission service charge for the use of the
ERCOT transmission system in exporting power from ERCOT based on scheduled exports and the
rates established under subsections (c) and (d) of this section. The intervals must consist of one hour.
(2) The hourly transmission rate for exports from ERCOT will be the TSP’s annual rate established
under subsections (c) and (d) of this section divided by 8760.
(3) The entity scheduling the export of power over a DC tie is solely responsible to the TSP for payment
of transmission service charges under this subsection.
(4) Beginning with the January 2023 reporting month, ERCOT must file a public report with the
commission stating the total amount of energy imported and the total amount of energy exported
over each DC tie for the calendar month. The report must also include the total amount of energy
exported from the ERCOT region during the reporting month and each of the preceding 11 calendar
months, reported by scheduling entity. Each report must be filed within 45 days of the end of the
reporting month.

(P 53169)
(f) Transmission revenue. Revenue from the transmission of electric energy out of the ERCOT region over
the DC ties that is recovered under subsection (e) of this section shall be credited to all transmission service
customers as a reduction in the transmission cost of service for TSPs that receive the revenue.
(g) Revision of transmission rates. Each TSP in the ERCOT region shall periodically revise its transmission
service rates to reflect changes in the cost of providing such services. Any request for a change in
transmission rates shall comply with the filing requirements established by the commission under this section.
(h) Interim Update of Transmission rates.
(1) Frequency. Each TSP in the ERCOT region may apply to update its transmission rates on an
interim basis not more than once per calendar year to reflect changes in its invested capital. Upon
the effective date of an amendment to §25.193 pursuant to an order in Project Number 37909,
Rulemaking Proceeding to Amend P.U.C. Subst. R. 25.193, Relating to Distribution Service
Provider Transmission Cost Recovery factors (TCRF), that allows a distribution service provider to
recover, through its transmission cost recovery factor, all transmission costs charged to the
distribution service provider by TSPs, each TSP in the ERCOT region may apply to update its
transmission rates on an interim basis not more than twice per calendar year to reflect changes in its
invested capital. If the TSP elects to update its transmission rates, the new rates shall reflect the
addition and retirement of transmission facilities and include appropriate depreciation, federal
income tax and other associated taxes, and the commission-authorized rate of return on such
facilities as well as changes in loads. If the TSP does not have a commission-authorized rate of
return, an appropriate rate of return shall be used.
(2) Reconciliation. An update of transmission rates under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be
subject to reconciliation at the next complete review of the TSP’s transmission cost of service, at
which time the commission shall review the costs of the interim transmission plant additions to
determine if they were reasonable and necessary. Any amounts resulting from an update that are
found to have been unreasonable or unnecessary, plus the corresponding return and taxes, shall be
refunded with carrying costs determined as follows: for the time period beginning with the date on
which over-recovery is determined to have begun to the effective date of the TSP’s rates set in that
complete review of the TSP’s transmission cost of service, carrying costs shall be calculated using
the same rate of return that was applied to the transmission investments included in the update. For
the time period beginning with the effective date of the TSP’s rates set in that complete review of
the TSP’s transmission cost of service, carrying costs shall be calculated using the TSP’s rate of
return authorized in that complete review.
(3) Future consideration of effect on TSP’s financial risk and rate of return. For a TSP that has
increased its rates pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the commission may, in setting rates
in the next complete review of the TSP’s transmission cost of service, expressly consider the effects
of reduced regulatory lag resulting from the interim updates to the TSP’s rates and the concomitant
impact on the TSP’s financial risk and rate of return.
(4) Commission processing of application. The commission shall process an application filed
pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection in the following manner.
(A) Notice and intervention deadline. The applicant shall provide notice of its application to
all parties in the applicant’s last complete review of the applicant’s transmission cost of
service and all of the distribution service providers listed in the last docket in which the
commission set the annual transmission service charges for the Electric Reliability Council
of Texas. The intervention deadline shall be 21 days from the date service of notice is
completed.

allowed to include within its tariff a TCRF clause that authorizes the DSP to charge or credit its
customers for the amount of wholesale transmission cost changes approved or allowed by the
commission to the extent that such costs vary from the transmission service cost utilized to fix the
base rates of the DSP. The DSP shall update its TCRF twice per year on March 1 and September 1
to pass through the wholesale transmission cost changes billed by a TSP. For the March 1 update,
the DSP shall file a request to update its TCRF no later than December 1; and for the September 1
update, no later than June 1. Within 45 days after a DSP files a request to update its TCRF, the
commission shall issue an order establishing the amount of the revised TCRF and suspend the
effective date of the revised TCRF as necessary so that the new TCRF charges will take effect on
March 1 or September 1, as applicable.
(2) A DSP shall include in its TCRF update calculation:
(A) the cost of wholesale transmission cost changes approved or allowed by the commission to
the extent that such costs vary from the transmission service cost utilized to fix the rates of
the DSP; and
(B) an adjustment amount, which shall equal:
(i) the actual costs paid by the DSP during the review period to TSPs as a result of
increases in the TSPs’ wholesale transmission rates above the wholesale
transmission rates of the TSPs used to develop the retail transmission charges of
the DSP in the DSP’s last rate case; minus
(ii) the revenues recovered through the DSP’s TCRF minus the portion of the
adjustments approved by the commission in the DSP’s most recent two TCRF
filings that were in effect during the review period.
(iii) For a March 1 TCRF update, the adjustment shall reflect the six-month period
beginning with the preceding May 1 and continuing through October 31 (review
period); for a September 1 update, the adjustment shall reflect the six-month
period beginning with the preceding November 1 and continuing through April
30 (review period). In no event shall a DSP’s TCRF clause result in the DSP
recovering more than its actual cost of wholesale transmission service included in
the TCRF.

Subchapter I. TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
DIVISION 1: OPEN-ACCESS COMPARABLE TRANSMISSION SERVICE FOR ELECTRIC
UTILITIES IN THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY COUNCIL OF TEXAS
Effective 3/07/24
(P-55566)
§25.195. Terms and Conditions for Transmission Service.
(a) Applicability. This section applies to the provision of transmission service in the Electric Reliability Council
of Texas (ERCOT) region by transmission service providers (TSPs) to transmission service customers. This
section also applies to ERCOT.
(b) Definitions. The following terms have the following meanings unless context indicates otherwise.
(1) Transmission-level generator -- a transmission service customer that is an electric generating
facility under §25.5 of this title (relating to Definitions), is interconnected to a TSP’s system at or
above 60 kilovolts (kV), and is located behind one or more unique points of interconnection.
(2) Transmission system upgrade -- any additional transmission facilities or modifications beyond
what is required to interconnect a transmission-level generator to the transmission system. The
construction of a new substation or modifications to an existing substation is not a transmissionsystem upgrade if necessary to interconnect a transmission-level generator.
(c) Interconnection agreement. As a condition of obtaining transmission service, a transmission service
customer that owns electrical facilities in the ERCOT region must execute an interconnection agreement with
the TSP to which it is physically interconnected. The commission-approved standard generation
interconnection agreement (SGIA) must be used for the interconnection of a new transmission service
customer that is a transmission-level generator. The SGIA may be modified by mutual agreement of the
parties to address specific facts presented by a particular interconnection request provided that the
modifications do not frustrate the goal of expeditious, nondiscriminatory interconnection and are not
otherwise inconsistent with the principles underlying the commission-approved SGIA. The SGIA must not
be modified to relieve a transmission-level generator’s responsibility for all costs of installing interconnection
facilities that are incurred by the TSP that exceed the allowance under subsection (f) of this section.
(d) Transmission service provider responsibilities. The TSP must plan, construct, operate, and maintain its
transmission system in accordance with good utility practice to provide transmission service customers with
transmission service over its transmission system in accordance with Division 1 of this subchapter (relating
to Open-Access Comparable Transmission Service for Electric Utilities in the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas). The TSP must, consistent with good utility practice, endeavor to construct and place into service
sufficient transmission capacity to ensure adequacy and reliability of the network to deliver power to
transmission service customer loads. The TSP must plan, construct, operate, and maintain facilities that are
needed to relieve transmission constraints, as recommended by ERCOT and approved by the commission, in
accordance with Division 1 of this subchapter. The construction of facilities requiring commission issuance
of a certificate of convenience and necessity is subject to such commission approval.
(e) Construction of new facilities. If new transmission facilities or interconnections between TSPs are needed
to provide transmission service in response to a request for such service, the TSPs must construct or acquire
transmission facilities necessary to provide the transmission service in accordance with good utility practice,
unless ERCOT identifies an alternative means of providing the transmission service that is less costly, is
operationally sound, and is as effective as the new transmission facilities would be at providing the requested
transmission service.
(1) An affected TSP may require the transmission service customer to pay a reasonable deposit or
provide another means of security, to cover the costs of planning, licensing, and constructing any
new transmission facilities that will be required in order to provide the requested service. Any
repayment of a cash deposit under subparagraphs (A) or (B) of this paragraph must include interest
at a commercially reasonable rate based on that portion of the deposit being returned.

Subchapter I. TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
DIVISION 1: OPEN-ACCESS COMPARABLE TRANSMISSION SERVICE FOR ELECTRIC
UTILITIES IN THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY COUNCIL OF TEXAS
Effective 3/07/24
(P-55566)
(A) If the new transmission service customer’s interconnection is completed and the
transmission service customer begins to take the requested transmission service, the TSP
must return the deposit or security to the transmission service customer.
(B) If the new transmission service customer’s interconnection is not completed and the new
transmission facilities are not required, the TSP may retain as much of the deposit or
security as is required to cover the costs the TSP incurred in planning, licensing, and
construction activities related to the planned new transmission facilities.
(2) If the TSP’s acquisition or construction of the new transmission facilities would impair the taxexempt status of obligations issued by the TSP then the TSP may require a contribution in aid of
construction (CIAC) from the transmission service customer to cover all or part of the cost of
acquiring and constructing the new transmission facilities.
(3) For a transmission service customer that is not a transmission-level generator, the TSP is responsible
for the cost of installing any new transmission facilities, other than those provided for in paragraph
(2) of this subsection, in a contractual agreement between the TSP and the customer, or in a
commission-approved transmission service tariff.
(4) For a transmission-level generator, the costs of installing new transmission facilities must be borne
in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.
(f) Cost responsibilities to interconnect transmission-level generatorsat transmission voltage.
(1) A new transmission-level generator seeking interconnection to a TSP’s transmission network is
responsible for the cost of installing step-up transformers and protective devices at the point of
interconnection capable of electrically isolating the transmission-level generator.
(2) If the SGIA between the transmission-level generator and the TSP is executed on or before
December 31, 2025, then the TSP is responsible for the cost of installing any new transmission
facilities.
(3) If the SGIA between a transmission-level generator and TSP is executed after December 31, 2025,
then the interconnecting transmission-level generator is responsible for all costs of installing
interconnection facilities that are incurred by the TSP that exceed the allowance established in
accordance with this paragraph. The TSP is responsible for the costs of installing any transmission
system upgrades deemed necessary by the TSP.
(A) The allowance will be calculated by the commission as follows:
(i) For a transmission-level generator interconnecting at a transmission voltage of
138 kV or less, the allowance beginning on January 1, 2026, is based on the 2024
amount of $14,000,000 adjusted for subsequent years consistent with clause (ii)
of this subparagraph. For a transmission-level generator interconnecting at a
transmission voltage higher than 138kV, the allowance beginning on January 1,
2026, is based on the 2024 amount of $20,000,000 adjusted for subsequent years
consistent with clause (ii) of this subparagraph.
(ii) The commission will increase or decrease the allowance on or before January 1
of each calendar year in accordance with this clause. The commission will publish
the new values of the allowance to be used in the subsequent calendar year on or
around November 1 of each calendar year.
(I) The annual adjustment will be proportional to the third quarter to third
quarter percentage change in the national Consumer Price Index (CPI)
published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
(II) The executive director must designate a substitute index to be used as a
reference for adjustments under this clause if the index referenced by
subclause (I) of this clause becomes unavailable.

(B) A transmission-level generator that seeks to interconnect an energy storage resource is only
eligible to receive the allowance described under this subsection and not additional
allowances provided to interconnect load, such as may be provided under a tariff.
(C) The amount of the allowance that a transmission-level generator is provided to complete
the interconnection is the amount that was in effect on the date the notice to proceed with
the interconnection was issued by the transmission-level generator to the TSP in
accordance with the executed SGIA. A TSP’s costs to procure, design, and construct or
upgrade interconnection facilities that exceed the allowance must be directly billed to and
collected from the transmission-level generator that caused the costs to be incurred by the
TSP. The TSP may collect such costs as a contribution in aid to construction prior to
procuring, designing, and constructing or upgrading the interconnection facilities.
(D) Notwithstanding any payments made by a transmission-level generator under this section,
an interconnecting TSP retains ownership and control of its transmission facilities.
(E) After the completion and energization of the initial interconnection, the responsibility for
costs incurred by a TSP for new or upgraded interconnection facilities due to modifications
or expansions made by the interconnected transmission-level generator will be borne in
accordance with this subparagraph.
(i) For the ten calendar years following the date of energization for the initial
interconnection of the transmission-level generator, and to the extent that the costs
of the new or upgraded interconnection facilities needed due to modifications
made by the transmission-level generator exceed the remainder of the allowance
calculated under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the current owner of the
transmission-level generator that is listed in the new or amended SGIA is
responsible for the interconnection costs incurred by the TSP, where:
(I) the allowance is the amount that was in effect on the date the notice to
proceed with the initial interconnection was issued in accordance with
paragraph (3) of this subsection and the executed SGIA; and
(II) the remainder is the difference between the allowance described under
subclause (I) of this clause and the actual costs that a TSP incurred to
construct, design, and upgrade interconnection facilities to initially
interconnect the transmission-level generator. The remainder will be
adjusted by the TSP in accordance with the methodology in
subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph.
(ii) After ten calendar years from the date of energization for the initial
interconnection, the transmission-level generator is eligible for a new allowance
determined in accordance with paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection for the costs
of new or upgraded interconnection facilities necessary to accommodate
modifications made by the transmission-level generator at the same point of
interconnection.
(F) Beginning on or around May 1, 2029, and at least every five calendar years thereafter, the
commission will open a project and request comments on whether the allowance or annual
allowance adjustment methodology described in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection should
be modified. If the commission determines the allowance or the annual allowance
adjustment methodology should be adjusted, the commission will initiate a rulemaking
proceeding.
(g) Curtailment of service. In an emergency situation, as determined by ERCOT and at its direction, a TSP may
interrupt transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis, if necessary, to preserve the stability of the
transmission network and service to customers. Such curtailments must be carried out in accordance with

ERCOT protocols.
(h) Filing of contracts. An electric utility must file with the commission each new, and all amendments to,
interconnection agreements within 30 days of execution, including a cover letter explaining any deviations
from the commission-approved SGIA. An interconnection agreement is subject to commission review and
approval upon request by any party to the agreement. Appropriate portions of the filings may be filed
confidentially and be subject to provisions of confidentiality to protect competitively sensitive commercial
or financial information.
(i) Transmission-level generator interconnection costs report. ERCOT must, in consultation with
commission staff, include as part of the ERCOT Generation Interconnection Status report or any successor
report the generation interconnection costs for each new transmission-level generator interconnected in each
calendar month based on date of energization, including the total cost of the interconnection, any CIAC paid
by the transmission-level generator, and any above-allowance costs incurred by the transmission-level
generator.
(1) Beginning in January 2026, within 90 calendar days from the end of each calendar month the TSP
must provide to ERCOT the information described in this subsection for each new transmissionlevel generator interconnection to the TSP’s system in that calendar month.
(2) Beginning in April 2027 and every calendar year thereafter, ERCOT will publish the information
described in this subsection in a separate report for each new transmission-level generator
interconnection to the ERCOT transmission system in the prior calendar year. ERCOT will, at a

§25.198. Initiating Transmission Service.
(a) Initiating service. Where a transmission service customer uses the transmission facilities in the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), whether its own facilities or those of another transmission service
provider (TSP), to serve load or to make sales of energy to a third party, it shall apply for transmission service
pursuant to this section, the ERCOT protocols, and commission-approved tariffs.
(b) Conditions precedent for receiving service. Subject to the terms and conditions of this section and in
accordance with the ERCOT protocols and commission-approved tariffs, the TSP will provide transmission
service to any transmission service customer as that term is defined in §25.5 of this title (relating to
Definitions), provided that:
(1) the transmission service customer has complied with the applicable provisions of the ERCOT
protocols;
(2) the transmission service customer and the TSP have completed the technical arrangements set forth in
subsection (e) of this section; and
(3) if the transmission service customer operates electrical facilities that are interconnected to the facilities
of a TSP, it has executed an interconnection agreement for service under this section or requested in
writing that the TSP file a proposed unexecuted agreement with the commission.
(c) Procedures for initiating transmission service. A transmission service customer requesting transmission
service under this section must comply with the ERCOT protocols and commission-approved tariffs.
(1) The transmission service customer shall provide all information deemed necessary by ERCOT to
evaluate the transmission service.
(2) ERCOT must acknowledge the request within ten days of receipt. When the request is complete, the
acknowledgment must include a date by which a response will be sent to the transmission service
customer and a statement of any fees associated with responding to the request (e.g., system studies).
(3) If a transmission service customer fails to provide ERCOT with all information deemed necessary,
then ERCOT shall notify the transmission service customer requesting service within 15 business days
of receipt and specify the reasons for such failure. Wherever possible, ERCOT will attempt to remedy
deficiencies in the application through informal communications with a transmission service customer.
(4) If ERCOT determines that a system security screening study is required, upon approval of the
requesting transmission service customer, ERCOT will initiate such a study. If this study concludes
that the transmission system is adequate to accommodate the request for service, either in whole or in
part, or that no costs are likely to be incurred for new transmission facilities or upgrades, the
transmission service will be initiated or tendered, within 15 business days of completion of the system
security screening study.
(5) If ERCOT determines as a result of the system security screening study that additions or upgrades to
the transmission system are needed to supply the transmission service customer’s forecasted
transmission requirements, the TSP will, upon the approval of the requesting transmission service
customer, initiate a facilities study. When completed, a facilities study will include an estimate of the
cost of any required facilities or upgrades and the time required to complete such construction and
initiate the requested service.
(6) When a transmission service customer requests transmission service for a new resource under this
section, ERCOT shall establish the scope of any system security screening study. The study will be
used to determine the feasibility of integrating such new resource into the TSPs’ transmission system,
and whether any upgrades of facilities providing transmission are needed. ERCOT will perform the
system security screening study.
(A) ERCOT shall complete the system security screening study and provide the results to the
transmission service customer within 90 days after the receipt of an executed study agreement

provide the transmission service customer a written explanation of when the study will be
completed and the reasons for the delay.
(B) The requesting transmission service customer shall be responsible for the cost of the system
security screening study and shall be provided with the results thereof, including relevant work
papers to the extent such results and workpapers do not contain protected competitive
information as reasonably determined by ERCOT.
(C) ERCOT will use a methodology consistent with good utility practice to conduct the system
security screening study and shall coordinate with affected TSPs as needed in determining the
most efficient means for all TSPs in the ERCOT region to assure feasibility of transmission
service.
(d) Facilities study. Based on the results of the system security screening study, the TSP shall perform, pursuant
to an executed facilities study agreement with the transmission service customer, a facilities study addressing
the detailed engineering, design and cost of transmission facilities required to provide the requested
transmission service.
(1) The facilities study will be completed as soon as reasonably practicable. If the TSP may charge a
contribution in aid of construction under §25.195 of this title (relating to Terms and Conditions for
Transmission Service), the TSP shall notify the transmission service customer whether it considers
that a contribution in aid of construction is appropriate and the amount of the contribution. The TSP
shall base its request on the information in the system security screening study, the facilities study,
good utility practice, and §25.195 of this title.
(2) The transmission service customer shall be responsible for the reasonable cost of the facilities study
pursuant to the terms of the facilities study agreement and shall be provided with the results of the
facility study, including relevant workpapers.
(3) Pursuant to §25.195(c)(2) of this title, the TSP shall be responsible for the costs of any planning,
designing, and constructing of facilities of the TSP associated with its addition of new facilities used
to provide transmission service.
(e) Technical arrangements to be completed prior to commencement of service. Service under this section
shall not commence until the installation has been completed of all equipment specified under the
interconnection agreement, consistent with guidelines adopted by the national reliability organization and
ERCOT, except that the TSP shall provide the requested transmission service, to the extent that such service
does not impair the reliability of other transmission service. The TSP shall exercise reasonable efforts, in
coordination with the transmission service customer, to complete such arrangements as soon as practical prior
to the service commencement date.
(f) Transmission service customer facilities. The provision of transmission service shall be conditioned upon
the transmission service customer’s constructing, maintaining and operating the facilities on its side of each
point of interconnection that are necessary to reliably interconnect and deliver power from a resource to the
transmission system and from the transmission system to the transmission service customer’s loads.
(g) Transmission arrangements for resources located outside of the ERCOT region. If a transmission
service customer intends to import power from outside the ERCOT region, it shall make any transmission
arrangements necessary for delivery of capacity and energy from the resource to an interconnection with
ERCOT.

title, ERCOT shall file a response to the application within 14 days after it receives the notice required under
subsection (g) of this section. ERCOT shall include as part of the response all existing, non-privileged
documents that support ERCOT’s position on the issues identified by the applicant.
(e) Standard for review. The commission may require an electric utility or a transmission and distribution
utility to construct or enlarge transmission facilities to ensure safe and reliable service for the state’s electric
markets and to reduce transmission constraints within ERCOT in a cost-effective manner where the
constraints are such that they are not being resolved through Chapter 37 or the ERCOT transmission planning
process. An applicant bears the burden of persuading the commission that the facilities are necessary to ensure
safe and reliable service for the state’s electric markets or to reduce transmission constraints within ERCOT
in a cost-effective manner.
(f) Threshold requirements. In its request, the applicant must plead facts that are sufficient, if proven, to show
that the request is likely to be granted under the standards of this section.
(1) The applicant must provide sufficient information for the presiding officer to determine that the
transmission constraints are not being resolved through Chapter 37 or the ERCOT transmission
planning process. In particular, the applicant shall demonstrate that:
(A) the facilities are not the subject of a pending application for a certificate of convenience
and necessity; and
(B) the facilities have been presented to and considered in the ERCOT transmission planning
process and have been rejected, or have been approved with one or more conditions that
are tantamount to rejection, either in the regional planning process or by the board of
directors, or ERCOT has not acted upon the application within a reasonable amount of
time.
(2) Within 20 days after ERCOT has filed its response to the complaint pursuant to subsection (d) of
this section, the presiding officer shall make a recommendation as to whether the applicant has

this title (relating to Service of Pleadings and Documents), and in particular shall serve a copy of the
complaint on ERCOT’s General Counsel, every other entity from whom relief is sought, the Office of Public
Utility Counsel, and any other party as may be appropriate. The notice required by ERCOT under §22.251(e)
of this title shall also be provided to all transmission service providers in ERCOT.
(h) Cost effectiveness. Prior to granting a request filed pursuant to this section, the commission, together with
the applicant or other parties as appropriate, may undertake a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to consider
both quantitative and qualitative costs and benefits of the proposed facilities. The analysis should consider
at a minimum:
(1) capital costs;
(2) projected operation and maintenance costs;
(3) carrying costs of the proposed upgrade;
(4) a comparison of the cost of the proposed transmission project to other congestion-management
techniques, such as system re-dispatch;
(5) system reliability; and
(6) impact on wholesale power costs in the ERCOT region.
(i) Commission order. If the commission concludes that the applicant has demonstrated that the facilities are
needed to ensure safe and reliable service for the state’s electric markets or to reduce transmission constraints
within ERCOT in a cost-effective manner and that the constraints are not being resolved through Chapter 37
or the ERCOT transmission planning process, it shall order an electric or transmission and distribution utility
or utilities to construct or enlarge the requested facilities.
(1) The commission shall issue the final order in a proceeding initiated under this section not later than
the 180th day after the filing of a complete, non-deficient request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, the 180-day deadline may be extended by the commission for good cause.
(2) An order adopted under this section:
(A) except in the case of a municipally-owned utility, shall be contingent on the successful
outcome of the subsequent certificate of convenience and necessity proceeding for the
proposed facilities;
(B) except in the case of a municipally-owned utility, shall include a date, appropriate for the
required construction, by which the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility
ordered to construct the facilities will be required to file an application for a certificate of
convenience and necessity, which may be extended by the commission for good cause;
(C) shall provide that the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility need not prove
in any proceeding filed under PURA Chapter 37 that the construction or upgrade ordered
is necessary for the convenience, accommodation, convenience or safety of the public, and
need not address the factors listed in PURA §§37.056(c)(1)-(3) and (4)(E);
(D) except in the case of a municipally-owned utility, shall provide that in any proceeding filed
under PURA Chapter 37 the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility shall
present evidence regarding reasonable times for planning, licensing and constructing the
line, so that an appropriate timeline may be included in any commission final order granting
a certificate for a line; and,
(E) shall provide that the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility ordered to
construct or enlarge the requested facilities may request the inclusion of construction work
in progress (CWIP) in the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility’s

UTILITIES IN THE ELECTRIC RELIABILITY COUNCIL OF TEXAS
Effective 6/20/01
§25.200. Load Shedding, Curtailments, and Redispatch.
(a) Procedures. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) shall direct non-discriminatory emergency
load shedding and curtailment procedures for responding to emergencies on the transmission system in
accordance with ERCOT protocols.
(b) Congestion management principles. ERCOT shall develop and implement market mechanisms to manage
transmission congestion in accordance with ERCOT protocols.
(c) Transmission constraints. During any period when ERCOT determines that a transmission constraint exists
on the transmission system, and such constraint may impair the reliability of a transmission service provider’s
(TSP’s) system or adversely affect the operations of either a TSP or a transmission service customer, ERCOT
will take actions, consistent with good utility practice and the ERCOT protocols, that are reasonably
necessary to maintain the reliability of the TSP’s system and avoid interruption of service. ERCOT shall
notify affected TSPs and transmission service customers of the actions being taken. In these circumstances,
TSPs and transmission service customers shall take such action as ERCOT directs.
(1) Service to all transmission service customers shall be restored as quickly as reasonably possible.
(2) To the extent ERCOT determines that the reliability of the transmission system can be maintained by
redispatching resources, or when redispatch arrangements are necessary to facilitate generation and
transmission transactions for a transmission service customer, a transmission service customer will
initiate procedures to redispatch resources, as directed by ERCOT.
(3) To the greatest extent possible, any redispatch shall be made on a least-cost non-discriminatory basis.
Except in emergency situations, any redispatch under this section will provide for equal treatment
among transmission service customers.
(4) ERCOT shall keep records of the circumstances requiring redispatch and the costs associated with
each redispatch and file annual reports with the commission, describing costs, frequency and causes
of redispatch. Costs for relieving capacity constraints shall be allocated in a manner consistent with
the ERCOT protocols.
(d) System reliability. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a TSP may, consistent with good
utility practice and on a non-discriminatory basis, interrupt transmission service for the purpose of making
necessary adjustments to, changes in, or repairs to its lines, substations and other facilities, or where the
continuance of transmission service would endanger persons or property. In exercising this power, a TSP’s
liability shall be governed by §25.214 of this title (relating to Terms and Conditions of Retail Delivery
Service Provided by Investor Owned Transmission and Distribution Utilities). In addition, notwithstanding
any other provisions of this section, ERCOT may cause the interruption of transmission service for the
purpose of maintaining ERCOT system stability and safety. In exercising this power, ERCOT shall not be
liable for its ordinary negligence but may be liable for its gross negligence or intentional misconduct when
legally due.
(1) In the event of any adverse condition or disturbance on the TSP’s system or on any other system
directly or indirectly interconnected with the TSP’s system, the TSP, consistent with good utility
practice, may interrupt transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis in order to limit the extent
of damage from the adverse condition or disturbance, to prevent damage to generating or transmission
facilities, or to expedite restoration of service. The TSP shall consult with ERCOT concerning any
interruption in service, unless an emergency situation makes such consultation impracticable.
(2) The TSP will give ERCOT, affected transmission service customers, and affected suppliers of
generation as much advance notice as is practicable in the event of an interruption.
(3) If a transmission service customer fails to respond to established emergency load shedding and
curtailment procedures to relieve emergencies on the transmission system, the transmission service

customer shall be deemed to be in default. Any dispute over a transmission service customer’s default
shall be referred to alternative dispute resolution under §25.203 (relating to Alternative Dispute
Resolution (ADR)) and may subject the transmission service customer to an assessment of an
administrative penalty by the commission under Public Utility Regulatory Act §15.023.
(4) ERCOT shall report interruptions to the commission, together with a description of the events leading
to each interruption, the services interrupted, the duration of the interruption, and the steps taken to
restore service.
(e) Transition provision on priority for transmission service and ancillary services. Subsection (b) of this
section is effective upon implementation of a single control area in the ERCOT region. Until that date, the
current rules for priority of planned transmission service will continue, as provided by this subsection.
(1) Any redispatch under this section will provide for equal treatment among transmission service
customers, subject to the priorities set out by this paragraph. Planned transmission service shall have
priority over unplanned transmission service, and annual planned transmission service shall have
priority over planned transmission service of a shorter duration.
(A) Subject to the foregoing priorities, for applications for planned or unplanned transmission
service, complete applications filed earlier with the independent system operator shall have
priority over applications that are filed later. Timely requests for annual planned transmission
service will be accorded equal priority.
(B) Where a transmission service customer is using annual planned transmission service for a
resource that becomes unavailable due to an unplanned outage or the expiration of a power
supply contract, the transmission service customer shall have priority, in using the same
transmission capacity to transmit power from a replacement resource, over other requests for
unplanned transmission service or planned transmission service of a shorter duration.
(2) The price for redispatch services for annual planned transactions shall be based on the cost of providing
the service, which shall be allocated among transmission service customers in proportion to each
customer’s share of the transmission cost of service, as determined by the commission under §25.192
of this title (relating to Transmission Service Rates). For redispatch required to accommodate an
annual planned transaction, the electric utility providing the redispatch service shall provide
information documenting the costs incurred to provide the service to the independent system operator.
This information shall be available to affected persons.
(3) The cost of redispatch services for other transactions (including planned transmission service of a
duration of less than a year) shall be borne by the transmission service customer for whose benefit the
redispatch is made. Electric utilities shall provide binding advance bids for redispatch services for
unplanned transactions. The participants in unplanned transactions shall be promptly notified by the
independent system operator that their transactions may be or have been continued through redispatch;
shall be informed of the cost of the redispatch measures; and shall have the opportunity to abandon or
curtail their transactions to avoid additional redispatch costs.
(4) Electric utilities that have tariffs for ancillary services on the effective date of this section shall
continue to provide services under those tariffs until ERCOT implements a single control area in the
ERCOT region.
(5) The following words and terms, when used in this subsection, shall have the following meanings
unless the context indicates otherwise:
(A) Planned resources — Generation resources owned, controlled, or purchased by a transmission
customer, and designated as planned resources for the purpose of serving load.
(B) Planned transmission service — A service that permits a transmission service customer to use
the transmission service providers’ transmission systems for the delivery of power from planned
resources to loads on the same basis as the transmission service providers use their transmission
systems to reliably serve their native load customers.

§25.202. Commercial Terms for Transmission Service.
(a) Billing and payment. Within a reasonable time after the first day of each month, transmission service
providers (TSPs) shall issue invoices for the prior month’s transmission service to distribution service
providers (DSPs) and customers responsible for the export of power from the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas (ERCOT) region.
(1) An invoice for transmission service shall be paid so that the TSP will receive the funds by the 35th
calendar day after the date of issuance of the invoice, unless the TSP and the transmission service
customer agree on another mutually acceptable deadline. All payments shall be made in immediately
available funds payable to the TSP, or by wire transfer to a bank named by the service provider or by
other mutually acceptable terms.
(2) Interest on any unpaid amount shall be calculated by using the interest rate applicable to overbillings
and underbillings, set by the commission, and compounded monthly. Interest on delinquent amounts
shall be calculated from the due date of the bill to the date of payment. When payments are made by
mail, bills shall be considered as having been paid on the date of receipt by the TSP.
(3) In the event the transmission service customer fails, for any reason other than a billing dispute as
described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, to make payment to the TSP on or before the due
date, and such failure of payment is not corrected within 30 calendar days after the TSP notifies the
customer to cure such failure, the customer shall be deemed to be in default.
(A) Upon the occurrence of a default, the TSP may initiate a proceeding with the commission to
terminate service. If the commission finds that a default has occurred, the transmission service
customer shall pay to the TSP an amount equal to two times the amount of the payment that the
customer failed to pay, in addition to any other remedy ordered by the commission. In the event
of a billing dispute between the TSP and the transmission service customer, the TSP will
continue to provide service during the pendency of the proceeding, as long as the customer:
(i) continues to make all payments not in dispute; and
(ii) pays into an independent escrow account the portion of the invoice in dispute, pending
resolution of such dispute.
(B) If the transmission service customer fails to meet the requirements in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph, then the TSP will provide notice to the customer and to the commission of its intention
to terminate service.
(C) Any dispute arising in connection with the termination or proposed termination of service shall
be referred to the alternative dispute resolution process described in §25.203 of this title (relating
to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)).
(b) Indemnification and liability.
(1) Neither a transmission service customer nor TSP shall be liable to the other for damages for any act
that is beyond such party’s control, including any event that is a result of an act of God, labor
disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, insurrection, riot, fire, storm or flood, explosion, breakage
or accident to machinery or equipment, a curtailment, order, regulation or restriction imposed by
governmental, military, or lawfully established civilian authorities, or by the making of necessary
repairs upon the property or equipment of either party.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a transmission service customer
and TSP shall assume all liability for, and shall indemnify each other for, any losses resulting from
negligence or other fault in the design, construction, or operation of their respective facilities. Such
liability shall include a transmission service customer or TSP’s monetary losses, costs and expenses
of defending an action or claim made by a third person, payments for damages related to the death or
injury of any person, damage to the property of the TSP or transmission service customer, and
payments for damages to the property of a third person, and damages for the disruption of the business

of a third person. This paragraph does not create a liability on the part of a TSP or transmission service
customer to a retail customer or other third person, but requires indemnification where such liability
exists. The indemnification required under this paragraph does not include responsibility for the TSP’s
or transmission service customer’s costs and expenses of prosecuting or defending an action or claim
against the other, or damages for the disruption of the business of the service provider or customer.
The limitations on liability set forth in this subsection do not apply in cases of gross negligence or
intentional wrongdoing.
(c) Creditworthiness for transmission service. For the purpose of determining the ability of a transmission
service customer to meet its obligations related to transmission and any other obligation in Division 1 of this
subchapter (relating to Open-Access Comparable Transmission Service for Electric Utilities in the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas), a TSP may require reasonable credit review procedures. This review shall be
made in accordance with standard commercial practices.
(1) The TSP may require a transmission service customer to provide and maintain in effect during the
term of service, an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit in a reasonable amount as security to
meet its responsibilities and obligations under Division 1 of this subchapter or an alternative form of
security proposed by the customer and acceptable to the service provider and consistent with
commercial practices established by the Uniform Commercial Code that reasonably protects the TSP
against the risk of non-payment. Credit worthiness standards must be applied to all transmission
service customers on a non-discriminatory basis.
(2) If a transmission service customer is creditworthy, no letter of credit or alternative form of security
shall be required.

scheduled. A copy of the letter shall be served upon the other party to the dispute at the same time the
letter is filed with the commission.
(3) Only parties to the dispute may participate in the arbitration.
(4) Arbitration panel. Any arbitration initiated under this section shall be conducted before a threemember arbitration panel. Each party shall choose one arbitrator from the commission-approved list
of panel members. In the event there are more than two parties to the dispute, the parties shall jointly
select the two arbitrators. The two arbitrators chosen by the parties shall choose the chairman of the
arbitration panel. If the two arbitrators chosen by the parties are unable to agree on the selection of a
chairman, they will be dismissed and the parties shall select two different arbitrators from the approved
list. The arbitrators are not required to choose the chairman from the names of persons on the
commission’s list of panel members so long as the person chosen is qualified as an arbitrator. Panel
members chosen shall not have any current or past substantial business or financial relationships with
any party to the arbitration (other than previous arbitration experience). The chairman of the panel
shall make all necessary arrangements for arbitration to commence within ten working days of
completion of the panel.
(5) Procedures. The arbitrators shall provide each of the parties an opportunity to be heard and, except
as otherwise provided herein, shall generally conduct the arbitration in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and any applicable
commission rules. The panel may request that the parties provide additional technical information
relevant to the dispute. The arbitration panel shall render a decision within 30 calendar days from the
closing of the evidentiary record of the arbitration and shall notify the parties in writing of such

decision and the reasons therefore. The decision shall not be considered precedent in any future
proceeding.
(6) Basis for decision. The arbitrators shall be authorized only to interpret and apply the provisions of
the commission’s rules relating to transmission services, the commission-approved ERCOT protocols,
the transmission service provider’s (TSP) transmission tariff, and any service agreement entered into
under that tariff. The arbitrators shall have no power to modify or change any of the above in any
manner. The arbitrators may agree with the positions of one or more of the parties, or may recommend
a compromise position.
(7) If any party to the arbitration files a complaint before the commission, the arbitration panel decision
shall be filed in the commission’s Central Records and shall be considered by the commission in
preparing a Preliminary Order in the complaint proceeding. The complaint shall be docketed and may
be referred to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. The decision may be admitted in evidence
in any such complaint proceeding.
(8) Costs. Each party shall be responsible for the following costs, if applicable:
(A) its own costs incurred during the arbitration process;
(B) its pro rata share of the costs of the three arbitrators, pooled and shared evenly among the parties.
(e) Effect of pending alternative dispute resolution. The transaction which is the subject of the dispute shall
be allowed to go forward pending the resolution of the dispute to the extent system reliability is not affected.
(f) Effect on rights under law. Nothing in this section shall restrict the rights of any party to file a complaint
with the commission under relevant provisions of the Public Utility Regulatory Act or with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act or the right of a TSP to seek changes in the

this section.
(1) Use or application of the arbitration provisions in this subsection does not affect the jurisdiction of the
commission over any matters arising under this section.
(2) Nothing in this section shall restrict the right of a market participant to file a petition seeking direct
relief from the commission without first utilizing the alternative dispute resolution process where an
action by a TSP, distribution service provider (DSP), or ERCOT might inhibit the ability of a
transmission service customer to provide continuous and adequate service to its customers.
(3) Because of the imminent threat to the health and welfare of a TSP’s customers in the event of a
reliability problem, a petitioner’s dispute will be heard by the commission in an emergency session
except in those instances where a quorum of the commission is not present. In those instances where
a quorum is not present, the chairman of the commission shall have the authority to issue an interim
order to resolve the dispute so as to protect the reliability of the system, with the order remaining in
effect until such time as a quorum is present.

feeders represents more than 25% of the total load of the secondary network under consideration.
(2) A utility shall approve applications for other on-site generation facilities whose total generation is
less than the local customer’s load unless total distributed generation (including the new facility) on
affected feeders represents more than 25% of the total load of the secondary network under
consideration.
(3) A utility may postpone processing an application for an individual distributed generation facility
under this section if the total existing distributed generation on the targeted feeder represents more
than 25% of the total load of the secondary network under consideration. If that is the case, the
utility should conduct interconnection and network studies to determine whether, and in what
amount, additional distributed generation facilities can be safely added to the feeder or
accommodated in some other fashion. These studies should be completed within six weeks, and
application processing should then resume.
(4) A utility may reject applications for a distributed generation facility under this section if the utility
can demonstrate specific reliability or safety reasons why the distributed generation should not be
interconnected at the requested site. However, in such cases the utility shall work with the customer
to attempt to resolve such problems to their mutual satisfaction.
(5) A utility shall make all reasonable efforts to seek methods to safely and reliably interconnect
distributed generation facilities that will export power. This may include switching service to a
radial feed if practical and if acceptable to the customer.
(i) Pre-Interconnection studies for network interconnection of distributed generation. Prior to charging a
pre-interconnection study fee for a network interconnection of distributed generation, a utility shall first
advise the customer of the potential problems associated with interconnection of distributed generation with
its network system. For potential interconnections to network systems there shall be no pre-interconnection
study fee assessed for a facility with inverter systems under 20 kW. For all other facilities the utility may
charge the customer a fee to offset its costs incurred in the conduct of the pre-interconnection study. In those
instances where a utility conducts an interconnection study, the following shall apply:
(1) The conduct of such pre-interconnection studies shall take no more than four weeks;
(2) A utility shall prepare written reports of the study findings and make them available to the customer;
(3) The studies shall consider both the costs incurred and the benefits realized as a result of the
interconnection of distributed generation to the utility’s system; and
(4) The customer shall receive an estimate of the study cost before the utility initiates the study.
(j) Communications concerning proposed distributed generation projects. In the course of processing
applications for interconnection and parallel operation and in the conduct of pre-interconnection studies,
customers shall provide the utility detailed information concerning proposed distributed generation facilities.
Such communications concerning the nature of proposed distributed generation facilities shall be made
subject to the terms of §25.84 of this title (relating to Annual Reporting of Affiliate Transactions for Electric
Utilities), §25.272 of this title (relating to Code of Conduct for Electric Utilities and their Affiliates), and
§25.273 of this title (relating to Contracts between Electric Utilities and their Competitive Affiliates). A

system, the company shall provide the customer an estimate of the schedule and customer’s cost for
the upgrade. If the customer desires to proceed with the upgrade, the customer and the company
will enter into a contract for the completion of the upgrade. The interconnection shall take place no
later than two weeks following the completion of such upgrades, except in situations in which a
customer is not able to connect within two weeks following the completion of such upgrades, this
time may be extended by agreement of the electric utility and the customer. The utility shall employ
best reasonable efforts to complete such system upgrades in the shortest time reasonably practical.
(4) A utility shall use best reasonable efforts to interconnect facilities within the time frames described
in this subsection. If in a particular instance, a utility determines that it cannot interconnect a facility
within the time frames stated in this subsection, it will notify the applicant in writing of that fact.
The notification will identify the reason or reasons interconnection could not be performed in
accordance with the schedule and provide an estimated date for interconnection.
(5) All applications for interconnection and parallel operation shall be processed by the utility in a nondiscriminatory manner. Applications shall be processed in the order that they are received. It is
recognized that certain applications may require minor modifications while they are being reviewed
by the utility. Such minor modifications to a pending application shall not require that it be

§25.212. Technical Requirements for Interconnection and Parallel Operation of On-Site Distributed
Generation.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to describe the requirements and procedures for safe and effective
connection and operation of distributed generation.
(1) A customer may operate 60 Hertz (Hz), three-phase or single-phase generating equipment, whether
qualifying facility (QF) or non-QF, in parallel with the utility system pursuant to an interconnection
agreement, provided that the equipment meets or exceeds the requirements of this section.
(2) This section describes typical interconnection requirements. Certain specific interconnection locations
and conditions may require the installation and use of more sophisticated protective devices and
operating schemes, especially when the facility is exporting power to the utility system.
(3) If the utility concludes that an application for parallel operation describes facilities that may require
additional devices and operating schemes, the utility shall make those additional requirements known
to the customer at the time the interconnection studies are completed.
(4) Where the application of the technical requirements set forth in this section appears inappropriate for
a specific facility, the customer and utility may agree to different requirements, or a party may petition
the commission for a good cause exception, after making every reasonable effort to resolve all issues
between the parties.
(b) General interconnection and protection requirements.
(1) The customer’s generation and interconnection installation must meet all applicable national, state,
and local construction and safety codes.
(2) The customer’s generator shall be equipped with protective hardware and software designed to prevent
the generator from being connected to a de-energized circuit owned by the utility.
(3) The customer’s generator shall be equipped with the necessary protective hardware and software
designed to prevent connection or parallel operation of the generating equipment with the utility
system unless the utility system service voltage and frequency is of normal magnitude.
(4) Pre-certified equipment may be installed on a company’s utility systems in accordance with an
approved interconnection control and protection scheme without further review of their design by the
utility. When the customer is exporting to the utility system using pre-certified equipment, the
protective settings and operations shall be those specified by the utility.
(5) The customer will be responsible for protecting its generating equipment in such a manner that utility
system outages, short circuits or other disturbances including zero sequence currents and ferroresonant
over-voltages do not damage the customer’s generating equipment. The customer’s protective
equipment shall also prevent unnecessary tripping of the utility system breakers that would affect the
utility system’s capability of providing reliable service to other customers.
(6) For facilities greater than two megawatts (MW), the utility may require that a communication channel
be provided by the customer to provide communication between the utility and the customer’s facility.
The channel may be a leased telephone circuit, power line carrier, pilot wire circuit, microwave, or
other mutually agreed upon medium.
(7) Circuit breakers or other interrupting devices at the point of common coupling must be capable of
interrupting maximum available fault current. Facilities larger than two MW and exporting to the
utility system shall have a redundant circuit breaker unless a listed device suitable for the rated
application is used.
(8) The customer will furnish and install a manual disconnect device that has a visual break that is
appropriate to the voltage level (a disconnect switch, a draw-out breaker, or fuse block), and is
accessible to the utility personnel, and capable of being locked in the open position. The customer
shall follow the utility’s switching, clearance, tagging, and locking procedures, which the utility shall
provide for the customer.

DIVISION 2: TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION APPLICABLE TO ALL ELECTRIC
UTILITIES
Effective 12/21/99
(c) Prevention of interference. To eliminate undesirable interference caused by operation of the customer’s
generating equipment, the customer’s generator shall meet the following criteria:
(1) Voltage. The customer will operate its generating equipment in such a manner that the voltage levels
on the utility system are in the same range as if the generating equipment were not connected to the
utility’s system. The customer shall provide an automatic method of disconnecting the generating
equipment from the utility system if a sustained voltage deviation in excess of +5.0 % or –10% from
nominal voltage persists for more than 30 seconds, or a deviation in excess of +10% or –30% from
nominal voltage persists for more than ten cycles. The customer may reconnect when the utility system
voltage and frequency return to normal range and the system is stabilized.
(2) Flicker. The customer’s equipment shall not cause excessive voltage flicker on the utility system.
This flicker shall not exceed 3.0% voltage dip, in accordance with Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 519 as measured at the point of common coupling.
(3) Frequency. The operating frequency of the customer’s generating equipment shall not deviate more
than +0.5 Hertz (Hz) or –0.7 Hz from a 60 Hz base. The customer shall automatically disconnect the
generating equipment from the utility system within 15 cycles if this frequency tolerance cannot be
maintained. The customer may reconnect when the utility system voltage and frequency return to
normal range and the system is stabilized.
(4) Harmonics. In accordance with IEEE 519 the total harmonic distortion (THD) voltage shall not
exceed 5.0% of the fundamental 60 Hz frequency nor 3.0% of the fundamental frequency for any
individual harmonic when measured at the point of common coupling with the utility system.
(5) Fault and line clearing. The customer shall automatically disconnect from the utility system within
ten cycles if the voltage on one or more phases falls below -30% of nominal voltage on the utility
system serving the customer premises. This disconnect timing also ensures that the generator is
disconnected from the utility system prior to automatic re-close of breakers. The customer may
reconnect when the utility system voltage and frequency return to normal range and the system is
stabilized. To enhance reliability and safety and with the utility’s approval, the customer may employ
a modified relay scheme with delayed tripping or blocking using communications equipment between
customer and company.
(d) Control, protection and safety equipment requirements specific to single phase generators of 50
kilowatts (kW) or less connected to the utility’s system. Exporting to the utility system may require
additional operational or protection devices and will require coordination of operations with the host utility.
The necessary control, protection, and safety equipment specific to single-phase generators of 50 kW or less
connected to secondary or primary systems include an interconnect disconnect device, a generator disconnect
device, an over-voltage trip, an under-voltage trip, an over/under frequency trip, and a synchronizing check
for synchronous and other types of generators with stand-alone capability.
(e) Control, protection and safety equipment requirements specific to three-phase synchronous
generators, induction generators, and inverter systems. This subsection specifies the control, protection,
and safety equipment requirements specific to three phase synchronous generators, induction generators, and
inverter systems. Exporting to the utility system may require additional operational or protection devices
and will require coordination of operations with the utility.
(1) Three phase synchronous generators. The customer’s generator circuit breakers shall be threephase devices with electronic or electromechanical control. The customer is solely responsible for
properly synchronizing its generator with the utility. The excitation system response ratio shall not be
less than 0.5. The generator’s excitation system(s) shall conform, as near as reasonably achievable, to
the field voltage versus time criteria specified in American National Standards Institute Standard
C50.13-1989 in order to permit adequate field forcing during transient conditions. For generating
systems greater than two MW the customer shall maintain the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) of
each generating unit in service and operable at all times. If the AVR is removed from service for
maintenance or repair, the utility’s dispatching office shall be notified.

(2) Three-phase induction generators and inverter systems. Induction generation may be connected
and brought up to synchronous speed (as an induction motor) if it can be demonstrated that the initial
voltage drop measured on the utility system side at the point of common coupling is within the visible
flicker stated in subsection (c)(2) of this section. Otherwise, the customer may be required to install
hardware or employ other techniques to bring voltage fluctuations to acceptable levels. Linecommutated inverters do not require synchronizing equipment. Self-commutated inverters whether of
the utility-interactive type or stand-alone type shall be used in parallel with the utility system only
with synchronizing equipment. Direct-current generation shall not be operated in parallel with the
utility system.
(3) Protective function requirements. The protective function requirements for three phase facilities of
different size and technology are listed below.
(A) Facilities rated ten kilowatts (kW) or less must have an interconnect disconnect device, a
generator disconnect device, an over-voltage trip, an under-voltage trip, an over/under frequency
trip, and a manual or automatic synchronizing check (for facilities with stand alone capability).
(B) Facilities rated in excess of ten kW but not more than 500 kW must have an interconnect
disconnect device, a generator disconnect device, an over-voltage trip, an under-voltage trip, an
over/under frequency trip, a manual or automatic synchronizing check (for facilities with stand
alone capability), either a ground over-voltage trip or a ground over-current trip depending on
the grounding system if required by the company, and reverse power sensing if the facility is not
exporting (unless the generator is less than the minimum load of the customer).
(C) Facilities rated more than 500 kW but not more than 2,000 kW must have an interconnect
disconnect device, a generator disconnect device, an over-voltage trip, an under-voltage trip, an
over/under frequency trip, either a ground over-voltage trip or a ground over-current trip
depending on the grounding system if required by the company, an automatic synchronizing
check (for facilities with stand alone capability) and reverse power sensing if the facility is not
exporting (unless the facility is less than the minimum load of the customer). If the facility is
exporting power, the power direction protective function may be used to block or delay the under
frequency trip with the agreement of the utility.
(D) Facilities rated more than 2,000 kW but not more than 10,000 kW must have an interconnect
disconnect device, a generator disconnect device, an over-voltage trip, an under-voltage trip, an
over/under frequency trip, either a ground over-voltage trip or a ground over-current trip
depending on the grounding system if required by the company, an automatic synchronizing
check and AVR for facilities with stand alone capability, and reverse power sensing if the facility
is not exporting (unless the facility is less than the minimum load of the customer). If the facility
is exporting power, the power direction protective function may be used to block or delay the
under frequency trip with the agreement of the utility. A telemetry/transfer trip may also be
required by the company as part of a transfer tripping or blocking protective scheme.
(f) Facilities not identified. In the event that standards for a specific unit or facility are not set out in this
section, the company and customer may interconnect a facility using mutually agreed upon technical
standards.
(g) Requirements specific to a facility paralleling for sixty cycles or less (closed transition switching). The
protective devices required for facilities ten MW or less which parallel with the utility system for 60 cycles
or less are an interconnect disconnect device, a generator disconnect device, an automatic synchronizing
check for generators with stand alone capability, an over-voltage trip, an under-voltage trip, an over/under
frequency trip, and either a ground over-voltage trip or a ground over-current trip depending on the grounding
system, if required by the utility.
(h) Inspection and start-up testing. The customer shall provide the utility with notice at least two weeks before
the initial energizing and start-up testing of the customer’s generating equipment and the utility may witness

the testing of any equipment and protective systems associated with the interconnection. The customer shall
revise and re-submit the application with information reflecting any proposed modification that may affect
the safe and reliable operation of the utility system.
(i) Site testing and commissioning. Testing of protection systems shall include procedures to functionally test
all protective elements of the system up to and including tripping of the generator and interconnection point.
Testing will verify all protective set points and relay/breaker trip timing. The utility may witness the testing
of installed switchgear, protection systems, and generator. The customer is responsible for routine
maintenance of the generator and control and protective equipment. The customer will maintain records of
such maintenance activities, which the utility may review at reasonable times. For generation systems greater
than 500 kW, a log of generator operations shall be kept. At a minimum, the log shall include the date,
generator time on, and generator time off, and megawatt and megavar output. The utility may review such

PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
§25.231. Cost of Service.
(a) Components of cost of service. Except as provided for in subsection (c)(2) of this section, relating to
invested capital; rate base, and §23.23(b) of this title, (relating to Rate Design), rates are to be based upon an
electric utility’s cost of rendering service to the public during a historical test year, adjusted for known and
measurable changes. The two components of cost of service are allowable expenses and return on invested
capital.
(b) Allowable expenses. Only those expenses which are reasonable and necessary to provide service to the
public will be included in allowable expenses. In computing an electric utility’s allowable expenses, only
the electric utility’s historical test year expenses as adjusted for known and measurable changes will be
considered, except as provided for in any section of these rules dealing with fuel expenses.
(1) Components of allowable expenses. Allowable expenses, to the extent they are reasonable and
necessary, and subject to this section, may include, but are not limited to the following general
categories:
(A) Operations and maintenance expense incurred in furnishing normal electric utility service
and in maintaining electric utility plant used by and useful to the electric utility in providing
such service to the public. Payments to affiliated interests for costs of service, or any
property, right or thing, or for interest expense will not be allowed as an expense for cost
of service except as provided in the Public Utility Regulatory Act §36.058.
(B) Depreciation expense based on original cost and computed on a straight line basis as
approved by the commission. Other methods of depreciation may be used when it is
determined that such depreciation methodology is a more equitable means of recovering
the cost of the plant.
(C) Assessments and taxes other than income taxes.
(D) Federal income taxes on a normalized basis. Federal income taxes must be computed
according to the provisions of the Public Utility Regulatory Act §36.060.
(E) Advertising, contributions and donations. The actual expenditures for ordinary
advertising, contributions, and donations may be allowed as a cost of service provided that
the total sum of all such items allowed in the cost of service must not exceed three-tenths
of 1.0% (0.3%) of the gross receipts of the electric utility for services rendered to the public.
The following expenses must be included in the calculation of the three-tenths of 1.0%
(0.3%) maximum:
(i) funds expended advertising methods of conserving energy;
(ii) funds expended advertising methods by which the consumer can effect a savings
in total electric utility bills;
(iii) funds expended advertising methods to shift usage off of system peak; and
(iv) funds expended promoting renewable energy.
(F) Nuclear decommissioning expense. The following restrictions must apply to the inclusion
of nuclear decommissioning costs that are placed in an electric utility’s cost of service.
(i) An electric utility owning or leasing an interest in a nuclear-fueled generating unit
must include its cost of nuclear decommissioning in its cost of service. Funds
collected from ratepayers for decommissioning must be deposited monthly in
irrevocable trusts external to the electric utility, in accordance with §25.301 of
this title (relating to Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts). All funds held in shortterm investments must bear interest. The level of the annual cost of
decommissioning for ratemaking purposes will be determined in each rate case
based on an allowance for contingencies of 10% of the cost of decommissioning,
the most current information reasonably available regarding the cost of
decommissioning, the balance of funds in the decommissioning trust, anticipated 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
escalation rates, the anticipated return on the funds in the decommissioning trust,
and other relevant factors. The annual amount for the cost of decommissioning
determined pursuant to the preceding sentence must be expressly included in the
cost of service established by the commission’s order.
(ii) In the event that an electric utility implements an interim rate increase, including
an increase filed under bond, an incremental change in decommissioning funding
must be included in the increase.
(iii) An electric utility’s decommissioning fund and trust balances will be reviewed in
general rate cases. In the event that an electric utility does not have a rate case
within a five-year period, the commission, on its own motion or on the motion of
commission staff, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, or any affected person,
may initiate a proceeding to review the electric utility’s decommissioning cost
study and plan, and the balance of the trust.
(iv) An electric utility must perform, or cause to be performed, a study of the
decommissioning costs of each nuclear generating unit that it owns or in which it
leases an interest. A study or a redetermination of the previous study must be
performed at least every five years. The study or redetermination should consider
the most current information reasonably available on the cost of
decommissioning. A copy of the study or redetermination must be filed with the
commission and a copy provided to the Office of Public Utility Counsel. An
electric utility’s most recent decommissioning study or redeterminations must be
filed with the commission within 30 days of the effective date of this subsection.
The five-year requirement for a new study or redetermination must begin from
the date of the last study or redetermination.
(G) Accruals credited to reserve accounts for self-insurance under a plan requested by an
electric utility and approved by the commission. The commission may consider approval
of a self insurance plan in a rate case in which expenses or rate base treatment are requested
for a such a plan. For the purposes of this section, a self insurance plan is a plan providing
for accruals to be credited to reserve accounts. The reserve accounts are to be charged with
property and liability losses which occur, and which could not have been reasonably
anticipated and included in operating and maintenance expenses, and are not paid or
reimbursed by commercial insurance. The commission will approve a self insurance plan
to the extent it finds it to be in the public interest. In order to establish that the plan is in
the public interest, the electric utility must present a cost benefit analysis performed by a
qualified independent insurance consultant who demonstrates that, with consideration of
all costs, self-insurance is a lower-cost alternative than commercial insurance and the
ratepayers will receive the benefits of the self insurance plan. The cost benefit analysis
must present a detailed analysis of the appropriate limits of self insurance, an analysis of
the appropriate annual accruals to build a reserve account for self insurance, and the level
at which further accruals should be decreased or terminated.
(H) Postretirement benefits other than pensions (known in the electric utility industry as
“OPEB”). For ratemaking purposes, expense associated postretirement benefits other than
pensions (OPEB) must be treated as follows:
(i) OPEB expense must be included in an electric utility’s cost of service for
ratemaking purposes based on actual payments made.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(ii) An electric utility may request a one-time conversion to inclusion of current
OPEB expense in cost of service for ratemaking purposes on an accrual basis in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Rate
recognition of OPEB expense on an accrual basis must be made only in the context
of a full rate case.
(iii) An electric utility will not be allowed to recover current OPEB expense on an
accrual basis until GAAP requires that electric utility to report OPEB expense on
an accrual basis.
(iv) For ratemaking purposes, the transition obligation must be amortized over 20
years.
(v) OPEB amounts included in rates must be placed in an irrevocable external trust
fund dedicated to the payment of OPEB expenses. The trust must be established
no later than six months after the order establishing the OPEB expense amount
included in rates. The electric utility must make deposits to the fund at least once
per year. Deposits on the fund must include, in addition to the amount included
in rates, an amount equal to fund earnings that would have accrued if deposits had
been made monthly. The funding requirement can be met with deposits made in
advance of the recognition of the expense for ratemaking purposes. The electric
utility must, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, establish a
postretirement benefit plan that allows for current federal income tax deductions
for contributions and allows earnings on the trust funds to accumulate tax free.
(vi) When an electric utility terminates an OPEB trust fund established pursuant to
clause (v) of this subparagraph, it must notify the commission in writing. If excess
assets remain after the OPEB trust fund is terminated and all trust related liabilities
are satisfied, the electric utility must file, for commission approval, a proposed
plan for the distribution of the excess assets. The electric utility must not
distribute any excess assets until the commission approves the disbursement plan.
(2) Expenses not allowed. The following expenses must never be allowed as a component of cost of
service:
(A) legislative advocacy expenses, whether made directly or indirectly, including, but not
limited to, legislative advocacy expenses included in professional or trade association dues;
(B) funds expended in support of political candidates;
(C) funds expended in support of any political movement;
(D) funds expended promoting political or religious causes;
(E) funds expended in support of or membership in social, recreational, fraternal, or religious
clubs or organizations;
(F) funds promoting increased consumption of electricity;
(G) additional funds expended to mail any parcel or letter containing any of the items
mentioned in subparagraphs (A)-(F) of this paragraph;
(H) payments, except those made under an insurance or risk-sharing arrangement executed
before the date of the loss, made to cover costs of an accident, equipment failure, or
negligence at an electric utility facility owned by a person or governmental body not selling
power within the State of Texas;
(I) costs, including, but not limited to, interest expense, of processing a refund or credit of
sums collected in excess of the rate finally ordered by the commission in a case where the
electric utility has put bonded rates into effect, or when the electric utility has otherwise
been ordered to make refunds;
(J) any expenditure found by the commission to be unreasonable, unnecessary, or not in the
public interest, including but not limited to executive salaries, advertising expenses, legal

expenses, penalties and interest on overdue taxes, criminal penalties or fines, and civil
penalties or fines.
(c) Return on invested capital. The return on invested capital is the rate of return times invested capital.
(1) Rate of return. The commission will allow each electric utility a reasonable opportunity to earn a
reasonable rate of return, which is expressed as a percentage of invested capital, and will fix the rate
of return in accordance with the following principles.
(A) The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness
of the electric utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management,
to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper
discharge of its public duties. A rate of return may be reasonable at one time and become
too high or too low because of changes affecting opportunities for investment, the money
market, and business conditions generally.
(B) The commission will consider efforts by the electric utility to comply with the statewide
integrated resource plan, the efforts and achievements of the electric utility in the
conservation of resources, the quality of the electric utility’s services, the efficiency of the
electric utility’s operations, and the quality of the electric utility’s management, along with
other applicable conditions and practices.
(C) The commission may, in addition, consider inflation, deflation, the growth rate of the
service area, and the need for the electric utility to attract new capital. The rate of return
must be high enough to attract necessary capital but need not go beyond that. In each case,
the commission will consider the electric utility’s cost of capital, which is the weighted
average of the costs of the various classes of capital used by the electric utility.
(i) Debt capital. The cost of debt capital is the actual cost of debt at the time of
issuance, plus adjustments for premiums, discounts, and refunding and issuance
costs.
(ii) Equity capital. For companies with ownership expressed in terms of shares of
stock, equity capital commonly consists of the following classes of stock.
(I) Common stock capital. The cost of common stock capital must be based
upon a fair return on its market value.
(II) Preferred stock capital. The cost of preferred stock capital is the actual
cost of preferred stock at the time of issuance, plus an adjustment for
premiums, discounts, and refunding and issuance costs.
(2) Invested capital; rate base. The rate of return is applied to the rate base. The rate base, sometimes
referred to as invested capital, includes as a major component the original cost of plant, property,
and equipment, less accumulated depreciation, used and useful in rendering service to the public.
Components to be included in determining the overall rate base are as set out in subparagraphs (A)-
(F) of this paragraph.
(A) Original cost, less accumulated depreciation, of electric utility plant used by and useful to
the electric utility in providing service.
(i) Original cost must be the actual money cost, or the actual money value of any
consideration paid other than money, of the property at the time it would have
been dedicated to public use, whether by the electric utility which is the present
owner or by a predecessor.
(ii) Reserve for depreciation is the accumulation of recognized allocations of original
cost, representing recovery of initial investment, over the estimated useful life of
the asset. Depreciation must be computed on a straight line basis or by such other
method approved under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section over the expected
useful life of the item or facility.

PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.

Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(iii) Payments to affiliated interests must not be allowed as a capital cost except as
provided in the Public Utility Regulatory Act §36.058.
(B) Working capital allowance to be composed of, but not limited to the following:
(i) Reasonable inventories of materials, supplies, and fuel held specifically for
purposes of permitting efficient operation of the electric utility in providing
normal electric utility service. This amount excludes appliance inventories and
inventories found by the commission to be unreasonable, excessive, or not in the
public interest.
(ii) Reasonable prepayments for operating expenses. Prepayments to affiliated
interests will be subject to the standards set forth in the Public Utility Regulatory
§36.058.
(iii) A reasonable allowance for cash working capital. The following applies in
determining the amount to be included in invested capital for cash working
capital:
(I) Cash working capital for electric utilities must in no event be greater than
one-eighth of total annual operations and maintenance expense,
excluding amounts charged to operations and maintenance expense for
materials, supplies, fuel, and prepayments.
(II) For electric cooperatives, river authorities, and investor-owned electric
utilities that purchase 100% of their power requirements, one-eighth of
operations and maintenance expense excluding amounts charged to
operations and maintenance expense for materials, supplies, fuel, and
prepayments will be considered a reasonable allowance for cash working
capital.
(III) Operations and maintenance expense does not include depreciation,
other taxes, or federal income taxes, for purposes of subclauses (I), (II),
and (V) of this clause.
(IV) For all investor-owned electric utilities a reasonable allowance for cash
working capital, including a request of zero, will be determined by the
use of a lead-lag study. A lead-lag study will be performed in accordance
with the following criteria:
(-a-) The lead-lag study will use the cash method; all non-cash items,
including but not limited to depreciation, amortization, deferred
taxes, prepaid items, and return (including interest on long-term
debt and dividends on preferred stock), will not be considered.
(-b-) Any reasonable sampling method that is shown to be unbiased
may be used in performing the lead-lag study.
(-c-) The check clear date, or the invoice due date, whichever is later,
will be used in calculating the lead-lag days used in the study.
In those cases where multiple due dates and payment terms are
offered by vendors, the invoice due date is the date
corresponding to the terms accepted by the electric utility.
(-d-) All funds received by the electric utility except electronic
transfers must be considered available for use no later than the
business day following the receipt of the funds in any repository
of the electric utility (e.g. lockbox, post office box, branch
office). All funds received by electronic transfer will be
considered available the day of receipt.
(-e-) For electric utilities the balance of cash and working funds
included in the working cash allowance calculation must 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
consist of the average daily bank balance of all non-interest
bearing demand deposits and working cash funds.
(-f-) The lead on federal income tax expense must be calculated by
measurement of the interval between the mid-point of the
annual service period and the actual payment date of the electric
utility.
(-g-) If the cash working capital calculation results in a negative
amount, the negative amount must be included in rate base.
(V) If cash working capital is required to be determined by the use of a leadlag study under the previous subclause and either the electric utility does
not file a lead lag study or the electric utility’s lead-lag study is
determined to be so flawed as to be unreliable, in the absence of
persuasive evidence that suggests a different amount of cash working
capital, an amount of cash working capital equal to negative one-eighth
of operations and maintenance expense including fuel and purchased
power will be presumed to be the reasonable level of cash working
capital.
(C) Deduction of certain items which include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) accumulated reserve for deferred federal income taxes;
(ii) unamortized investment tax credit to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue
Code;
(iii) contingency and/or property insurance reserves;
(iv) contributions in aid of construction;
(v) customer deposits and other sources of cost-free capital;
(D) Construction work in progress (CWIP). The inclusion of construction work in progress is
an exceptional form of rate relief. Under ordinary circumstances the rate base must consist
only of those items which are used and useful in providing service to the public. Under
exceptional circumstances, the commission will include construction work in progress in
rate base to the extent that:
(i) the electric utility has proven that:
(I) the inclusion is necessary to the financial integrity of the electric utility;
and
(II) major projects under construction have been efficiently and prudently
planned and managed. However, construction work in progress must not
be allowed for any portion of a major project which the electric utility
has failed to prove was efficiently and prudently planned and managed;
or
(ii) for a project ordered by the commission under §25.199 of this title (relating to
Transmission Planning, Licensing and Cost-recovery for Utilities within the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas), if the commission determines that
conditions warrant the inclusion of CWIP in rate base, the project is being
efficiently and prudently planned and managed, and there will be a significant
delay between initial investment and the initial cost recovery for a transmission
project.
(E) Self-insurance reserve accounts. If a self insurance plan is approved by the commission,
any shortages to the reserve account will be an increase to the rate base and any surpluses
will be a decrease to the rate base. The electric utility must maintain appropriate books
and records to permit the commission to properly review all charges to the reserve account
and determine whether the charges being booked to the reserve account are reasonable and
correct.

(F) Requirements for post test year adjustments.
(i) Post test year adjustments for known and measurable rate base additions
(increases) to historical test year data will be considered only as set out in
subclauses (I)-(IV) of this clause.
(I) Where the addition represents plant which would appropriately be
recorded:
(-a-) for investor-owned electric utilities in FERC account 101 or
102;
(-b-) for electric cooperatives, the equivalent of FERC accounts 101
or 102.
(II) Where each addition comprises at least 10% of the electric utility’s
requested rate base, exclusive of post test year adjustments and CWIP.
(III) Where the plant addition is deemed by this commission to be in-service
before the rate year begins.
(IV) Where the attendant impacts on all aspects of a utility’s operations
(including but not limited to, revenue, expenses and invested capital)
can with reasonable certainty be identified, quantified and matched.
Attendant impacts are those that reasonably follow as a consequence of
the post test year adjustment being proposed.
(ii) Each post test year plant adjustment will be included in rate base at:
(I) the reasonable test year-end CWIP balance, if the addition is constructed
by the electric utility; or,
(II) the reasonable price, if the addition represents a purchase, subject to
original cost requirements, as specified in Public Utility Regulatory Act
§36.053.
(iii) Post test year adjustments for known and measurable rate base decreases to
historical test year data will be allowed only when clause (i)(IV) of this
subparagraph and the criteria described in subclauses (I) and (II) of this clause are
satisfied.
(I) The decrease represents:
(-a-) plant which was appropriately recorded in the accounts set forth
in clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph;
(-b-) plant held for future use;
(-c-) CWIP (mirror CWIP is not considered CWIP); or
(-d-) an attendant impact of another post test year adjustment.
(II) Plant that has been removed from service, mothballed, sold, or removed
from the electric utility’s books prior to the rate year.

§25.232. Adjustment for House Bill 11, Acts of 72nd Legislature, First Called Special Session 1991.
(a) Each electric utility that is subject to the commission’s rate setting jurisdiction, pays state franchise taxes,
and has not had a rate proceeding under the Public Utility Regulatory Act §36.103 and §36.151, in which the
effects of House Bill 11 were considered when setting the rates, shall be subject to this subsection. Except
as provided in the following sentence, on or before December 1 of each year, each electric utility subject to
this subsection shall file with the commission a tariff sheet, or tariff sheets, applicable to each rate class
setting forth an interim House Bill 11 tax adjustment factor. If an electric utility chooses not to request an
increase under this subsection or if the electric utility has otherwise limited itself by agreement to recovering
tax changes that are the subject of this subsection by a method different from that prescribed in this
subsection, the electric utility need not file tariff sheets but shall make an informational filing showing its
calculations, including an explanation and all underlying supporting documentation showing the effect of
House Bill 11 on its taxes. If the adjustment is a decrease that amounts to less than $1.00 per customer for
electric utilities on an annual basis, the tariff shall not include a factor, but shall state that the reduction will
be applied against the adjustment for future years. In all other tariffs, the factors set forth in the tariff sheets
shall be calculated as set forth in the following paragraphs. Electric utilities that are required to file tariff
sheets shall include an explanation of how the interim factor was calculated and showing all the calculations.
(b) If the adjustment is a decrease requiring a factor, or the electric utility affirmatively requests that an
adjustment be made to its billings to account for the effect of House Bill 11 on its state taxes, the tariff filing
will be docketed and will automatically go into effect on January 1 of the year following the filing. If the
adjustment is a decrease being carried forward to future years, the filing will be treated as a tariff filing except
that it shall take effect on January 1 of the year following the filing. An electric utility may amend a tariff
filed under this subsection to make mid-course corrections as necessary. For all amended filings, all tariffs
will take effect on the date specified by the electric utility, but in no event earlier than ten days after the filing.
(c) The interim House Bill 11 tax adjustment factor shall be calculated by allocating the effect on the electric
utility’s state taxes for the next calendar year of House Bill 11 as provided in subsection (f) of this section.
The effect on the electric utility’s state taxes for the coming calendar year shall be calculated by subtracting
the estimated state taxes attributable to the calendar year if the law prior to House Bill 11 were still in effect,
from the estimated state taxes due or attributable to the calendar year under House Bill 11. In calculating the
state taxes that would be due during the calendar year if the law prior to House Bill 11 were still in effect,
four-twelfths of the franchise tax paid or that would have been paid in the previous year and eight-twelfths
of the franchise tax that would have been paid in the calendar year in question will be considered attributable
to the calendar year in question. In performing the calculation, the various fees imposed by House Bill 11
will not be considered taxes. In calculating the taxes that are estimated to be paid, changes resulting from
audits or amended returns for previous periods that were covered by this rule shall be considered. The state
franchise tax imposed by House Bill 11 will be considered to be a franchise tax and not an income tax
regardless of the method of calculation.
(d) If an interim factor goes into effect, it shall be subject to surcharge or refund to the extent it differs from the
factor finally set by the commission. If a surcharge or refund is necessary, a credit or surcharge will be made
to the existing customers’ bills. If the refund or surcharge amount is less than either $10,000 in total or $1.00
per customer, calculated by dividing the total refund or surcharge by the total number of customers, the
electric utility may make the refund or surcharge by carrying it forward until a year when the cumulative
total refund or surcharge is not less than either $10,000 or $1.00 per customer. Simple interest will be added
to the amount due at the rate set by the commission for overbillings and underbillings starting at the beginning
of the month in which the obligation accrued and ending on the last day of the month preceding the refund
or surcharge. The month, or months, in which the obligation accrues will be determined by comparing the
collections each month under the tariff filed by the electric utility with the amount that should have been

collected had the electric utility been able to precisely predict its tax bill and its sales. The number of days
in each month shall be considered for purposes of the interest calculation. Interest will be added to decreases
that are carried to future years and will be calculated by the same method.
(e) The electric utility shall file, on or before the first business day after March 1 of the year following the year
when a particular factor was in effect, testimony supporting the final adjustment factor that it is requesting to
account for the effect of House Bill 11 on its state taxes for that year. The electric utility’s filing will include
a copy of the Franchise Tax Return filed with the Comptroller’s Office and the details of their computation
of the tax that would have been due had House Bill 11 not been enacted. The hearing on the merits for
purposes of setting the final factor, if necessary, shall be convened no earlier than 45 days after the filing of
the electric utility’s testimony and shall be strictly limited to issues under this subsection. For purposes of
administrative efficiency, the presiding officer assigned to a case may grant an electric utility’s request that
the final hearing on a particular year’s factor be delayed for up to three years; however, if such a request is
granted, any interest to be paid by the electric utility shall be at the utility’s cost of capital as determined in
the electric utility’s last rate case. Requests to delay the final hearing on a particular year’s factor shall be
filed with the testimony supporting the final adjustment factor.
(f) The billing adjustment should apply over the entire year; however, if the adjustment necessary to account for
the effect of House Bill 11 is so small that it would be difficult to apply on a monthly basis, the electric utility
may make the billing adjustment during a single month. Cost allocation and rate design are as follows.
(1) If the adjustment factor results in a lower cost to the ratepayers, the revenue decrease shall be allocated
to the customers on the same basis as the franchise taxes were allocated in the electric utility’s last rate
case.
(2) If the adjustment factor results in a greater cost to the ratepayers, the revenue increase will be allocated
to the customers in the same manner as were federal income taxes in the electric utility’s last rate case.
(3) The factor for each customer within a class will then be calculated based on expected kilowatt-hour
(kwh) sales and charged on a per kwh basis, except that the factor for each customer within an
industrial class served at transmission-level voltage will be calculated as a percentage of the base
revenues (excluding fuel, any applicable power cost recovery factor (PCRF) charges, and add-on
revenue taxes) received from that class during the most recent 12-month period.

§25.235. Fuel Costs — General.
(a) Purpose. The commission will set an electric utility’s rates at a level that will permit the electric utility a
reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital and to recover its reasonable and
necessary expenses, including the cost of fuel and purchased power. The commission recognizes in this
connection that it is in the interests of both electric utilities and their ratepayers to adjust charges in a timely
manner to account for changes in certain fuel and purchased-power costs. Pursuant to the Public Utility
Regulatory Act (PURA) §36.203 this section establishes a procedure for setting and revising fuel factors and
a procedure for regularly reviewing the reasonableness of the fuel expenses recovered through fuel factors.
(b) Notice of fuel proceedings. In addition to the notice required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
to be given by the commission, the electric utility is required to give notice of a fuel proceeding at the time
the petition is filed.
(1) Method of notice. Notice of fuel proceedings will be given by the electric utility as follows:
(A) Notice in all proceedings involving refunds, surcharges, or a proposal to change the fuel factor,
shall be by one-time publication in a newspaper having general circulation in each county of the
service area of the electric utility or by individual notice to each customer and by individual
notice to parties that participated in the electric utility’s prior fuel reconciliation proceeding;
(B) Notice in all reconciliation proceedings shall be by publication once each week for two
consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in each county of the service area
of the electric utility and by individual notice to each customer and to parties that participated in
the electric utility’s prior fuel reconciliation proceeding.
(2) Contents of notice.
(A) All notices required by this section shall provide the following information:
(i) the date the petition was filed;
(ii) a general description of the customers, customer classes, and territories affected by the
petition;
(iii) the relief requested;
(iv) the statement, “Persons with questions or who want more information on this petition
may contact (utility name) at (utility address) or call (utility toll-free telephone number)
during normal business hours. A complete copy of this petition is available for
inspection at the address listed above”; and
(v) the statement, “Persons who wish to formally participate in this proceeding , or who wish
to express their comments concerning this petition should contact the Public Utility
Commission of Texas, Office of Customer Protection, P.O. Box 13326, Austin, Texas
78711-3326, or call (512) 936-7120 or toll-free at (888) 782-8477. Hearing and speechimpaired individuals with text telephones (TTY) may call (512) 936-7136 or use Relay
Texas (toll-free) 1-800-735-2989.”
(B) Notices to revise fuel factors must also state the proposed fuel factors by type of voltage and the
period for which the proposed fuel factors are expected to be in effect.
(C) Notices to revise fuel factors, to refund, or to surcharge must contain the statement that, “these
changes will be subject to final review by the commission in the electric utility’s next
reconciliation,” unless, in the case of refunds or surcharges, the change is a result of a
reconciliation proceeding.
(D) Notices to reconcile fuel expenses must also state the period for which final reconciliation is
sought.
(3) Proof of notice may be demonstrated by appropriate affidavit. In fuel proceedings initiated by a
person other than an electric utility, the notice required in this subsection must be provided in
accordance with a schedule ordered by the presiding officer.

(c) Reports; confidentiality of information. Matters related to submitting reports and confidential information
will be handled as follows:
(1) The commission will monitor each electric utility’s actual and projected fuel-related costs and
revenues on a monthly basis. Each electric utility shall maintain and provide to the commission, in a
format specified by the commission, monthly reports containing all information required to monitor
monthly fuel-related costs and revenues, including generation mix, fuel consumption, fuel costs,
purchased power quantities and costs, and system and off-system sales revenues.
(2) Contracts for the purchase of fuel, fuel storage, fuel transportation, fuel processing, or power are
discoverable in fuel proceedings, subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements or protective
orders.
(3) The electric utility shall prepare a confidentiality disclosure agreement to be included as part of the
fuel reconciliation petition. The format for the agreement shall be the same as that contained in the
commission approved rate filing package. In addition to the agreement itself, Attachment 1 of the
agreement shall present a complete listing of the information required to be filed which the electric
utility alleges is confidential. Upon request and execution of the confidentiality agreement, the electric
utility shall provide any information which it alleges is confidential. If the electric utility fails to file
a confidentiality agreement, the deadline for a commission final order in the case is tolled until a
protective order is entered or a confidentiality agreement is filed. Use of the confidentiality disclosure
agreement does not constitute a finding that any information is proprietary and/or confidential under
law, or alter the burden of proof on that issue. The form of agreement contained in the commission
approved rate filing package does not bind the examiner or the commission to accept the language of
the agreement in the consideration of any subsequent protective order that may be entered.
(4) A party that cannot view a confidential document without receiving advantage as a competitor or
bidder may hire outside counsel and consultants to view the document subject to a protective order.

§25.236. Recovery of Fuel Costs.
(a) Eligible fuel expenses. Eligible fuel expenses include expenses properly recorded in the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Uniform System of Accounts, numbers 501, 502, 503, 509, 518, 536, 547, and 555,
as modified in this subsection, as of April 1, 2013, and the items specified in paragraph (8) of this subsection.
Any later amendments to the System of Accounts are not incorporated into this subsection. Subject to the
commission finding special circumstances under paragraph (7) of this subsection, eligible fuel expenses are
limited to:
(1) For any account, the electric utility may not recover, as part of eligible fuel expense, costs incurred
after fuel is delivered to the generating plant site, for example, but not limited to, operation and
maintenance expenses at generating plants, costs of maintaining and storing inventories of fuel at
the generating plant site, unloading and fuel handling costs at the generating plant, and expenses
associated with the disposal of fuel combustion residuals. Further, the electric utility may not
recover maintenance expenses and taxes on rail cars owned or leased by the electric utility,
regardless of whether the expenses and taxes are incurred or charged before or after the fuel is
delivered to the generating plant site. The electric utility may not recover an equity return or profit
for an affiliate of the electric utility, regardless of whether the affiliate incurs or charges the equity
return or profit before or after the fuel is delivered to the generating plant site. In addition, all
affiliate payments must satisfy the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §36.058.
(2) For Accounts 501 and 547, the only eligible fuel expenses are the delivered cost of fuel to the
generating plant site excluding fuel brokerage fees. For Account 501, revenues associated with the
disposal of fuel combustion residuals will also be excluded.
(3) For Account 502, the only eligible fuel expenses are environmental consumables that are: properly
recorded in the Account as chemicals; required to comply with applicable state or federal emission
reduction statutes, orders, and regulations; and whose use is directly proportional to the fuel
consumed to generate electricity.
(4) For Account 509, the only eligible fuel expenses are allowances expensed concurrent with the
monthly emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
(5) For Accounts 518 and 536, the only eligible fuel expenses are the expenses properly recorded in the
Account excluding brokerage fees. For Account 503, the only eligible fuel expenses are the
expenses properly recorded in the Account, excluding brokerage fees, return, non-fuel operation and
maintenance expenses, depreciation costs and taxes.
(6) For Account 555, the electric utility may not recover demand or capacity costs.
(7) Upon demonstration that such treatment is justified by special circumstances, an electric utility may
recover as eligible fuel expenses fuel or fuel related expenses otherwise excluded in paragraphs (1)
- (6) of this subsection. In determining whether special circumstances exist, the commission shall
consider, in addition to other factors developed in the record of the reconciliation proceeding,
whether the fuel expense or transaction giving rise to the ineligible fuel expense resulted in, or is
reasonably expected to result in, increased reliability of supply or lower fuel expenses than would
otherwise be the case, and that such benefits received or expected to be received by ratepayers
exceed the costs that ratepayers otherwise would have paid or otherwise would reasonably expect
to pay.
(8) Eligible fuel expenses shall not be offset by revenues by affiliated companies for the purpose of
equalizing or balancing the financial responsibility of differing levels of investment and operation
costs associated with transmission assets. In addition to the expenses designated in paragraphs (1)
- (7) of this subsection, unless otherwise specified by the commission, eligible fuel expenses shall
be offset by:
(A) revenues from steam sales included in Accounts 504 and 456 to the extent expenses
incurred to produce that steam are included in Account 503;

(P 41905)
(B) revenues from off-system sales in their entirety, except as permitted in paragraph (9) of
this subsection; and
(C) revenues from disposition of allowances properly recorded in Account 411.8.
(9) Shared margins from off-system sales. An electric utility may retain 10% of the margins from an
off-system energy sales transaction if the following criteria are met:
(A) the electric utility participates in a transmission region governed by an independent system
operator or a functionally equivalent independent organization;
(B) a generally-applicable tariff for firm and non-firm transmission service is offered in the
transmission region in which the electric utility operates; and
(C) the transaction is not found to be to the detriment of its retail customers.
(b) Reconciliation of fuel expenses. Electric utilities shall file petitions for reconciliation on a periodic basis so
that any petition for reconciliation shall contain a maximum of three years and a minimum of one year of
reconcilable data and will be filed no later than six months after the end of the period to be reconciled.
(c) Petitions to reconcile fuel expenses. In addition to the commission prescribed reconciliation application, a
fuel reconciliation petition filed by an electric utility must be accompanied by a summary and supporting
testimony that includes the following information:
(1) a summary of significant, atypical events that occurred during the reconciliation period that affected
the economic dispatch of the electric utility’s generating units, including but not limited to
transmission line constraints, fuel use or deliverability constraints, unit operational constraints, and
system reliability constraints;
(2) a general description of typical constraints that limit the economic dispatch of the electric utility’s
generating units, including but not limited to transmission line constraints, fuel use or deliverability
constraints, unit operational constraints, and system reliability constraints;
(3) the reasonableness and necessity of the electric utility’s eligible fuel expenses and its mix of fuel
used during the reconciliation period;
(4) a summary table that lists all the fuel cost elements which are covered in the electric utility’s fuel
cost recovery request, the dollars associated with each item, and where to find the item in the prefiled
testimony;
(5) tables and graphs which show generation (MWh), capacity factor, fuel cost (cents per kWh and cents
per MMBtu), variable cost and heat rate by plant and fuel type, on a monthly basis; and
(6) a summary and narrative of the next-day and intra-day surveys of the electricity markets and a
comparison of those surveys to the electric utility’s marginal generating costs.
(d) Fuel reconciliation proceedings. Burden of proof and scope of proceeding are as follows:
(1) In a proceeding to reconcile fuel factor revenues and expenses, an electric utility has the burden of
showing that:
(A) its eligible fuel expenses during the reconciliation period were reasonable and necessary
expenses incurred to provide reliable electric service to retail customers;
(B) if its eligible fuel expenses for the reconciliation period included an item or class of items
supplied by an affiliate of the electric utility, the prices charged by the supplying affiliate
to the electric utility were reasonable and necessary and no higher than the prices charged
by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions or to unaffiliated persons or
corporations for the same item or class of items; and
(C) it has properly accounted for the amount of fuel-related revenues collected pursuant to the
fuel factor during the reconciliation period.
(2) The scope of a fuel reconciliation proceeding includes any issue related to determining the
reasonableness of the electric utility’s fuel expenses during the reconciliation period and whether
the electric utility has over- or under-recovered its reasonable fuel expenses.

(e) Refunds. All fuel refunds and surcharges shall be made using the following methods.
(1) Interest shall be calculated on the cumulative monthly ending under- or over-recovery balance at
the rate established annually by the commission for overbilling and underbilling in §25.28 (c) and
(d) of this title (relating to Bill Payment and Adjustments). Interest shall be calculated based on
principles set out in subparagraphs (A) - (E) of this paragraph.
(A) Interest shall be compounded annually by using an effective monthly interest factor.
(B) The effective monthly interest factor shall be determined by using the algebraic calculation
x = (1 + i) (1/12) - 1; where i = commission-approved annual interest rate, and x = effective
monthly interest factor.
(C) Interest shall accrue monthly. The monthly interest amount shall be calculated by applying
the effective monthly interest factor to the previous month’s ending cumulative under/over
recovery fuel and interest balance.
(D) The monthly interest amount shall be added to the cumulative principal and interest
under/over recovery balance.
(E) Interest shall be calculated through the end of the month of the refund or surcharge.
(2) Rate class as used in this subparagraph shall mean all customers taking service under the same
tariffed rate schedule, or a group of seasonal agricultural customers as identified by the electric
utility.
(3) Interclass allocations of refunds and surcharges, including associated interest, shall be developed on
a month-by-month basis and shall be based on the historical kilowatt-hour usage of each rate class
for each month during the period in which the cumulative under- or over-recovery occurred, adjusted
for line losses using the same commission-approved loss factors that were used in the electric
utility’s applicable fixed or interim fuel factor.
(4) Intraclass allocations of refunds and surcharges shall depend on the voltage level at which the
customer receives service from the electric utility. Retail customers who receive service at
transmission voltage levels, all wholesale customers, and any groups of seasonal agricultural
customers as identified by the electric utility shall be given refunds or assessed surcharges based on
their individual actual historical usage recorded during each month of the period in which the
cumulative under- or over-recovery occurred, adjusted for line losses if necessary. All other
customers shall be given refunds or assessed surcharges based on the historical kilowatt-hour usage
of their rate class.
(5) Unless otherwise ordered by the commission, all refunds shall be made through a one-time bill credit
and all surcharges shall be made on a monthly basis over a period not to exceed 12 months through
a bill charge. However, refunds may be made by check to municipally-owned electric utility
systems if so requested. Retail customers who receive service at transmission voltage levels, all
wholesale customers, and any groups of seasonal agricultural customers as identified by the electric
utility shall be given a one-time credit or assessed a surcharge made on a monthly basis over a period
not to exceed 12 months through a bill charge. All other customers shall be given a credit or assessed
a surcharge based on a factor which will be applied to their kilowatt-hour usage over the refund or
surcharge period. This factor will be determined by dividing the amount of refund or surcharge
allocated to each rate class by forecasted kilowatt-hour usage for the class during the period in which
the refund or surcharge will be made.
(6) A petition to surcharge or refund a fuel under- or over-recovery balance not associated with a
proceeding under subsection (d) of this section shall be processed in accordance with the filing
schedules in §25.237(d) of this title (relating to Fuel factors) and the deadlines in §25.237(e) of this
title.
(f) Procedural schedule. Upon the filing of a petition to reconcile fuel expenses in a separate proceeding, the
presiding officer shall set a procedural schedule that will enable the commission to issue a final order in the

proceeding within one year after a materially complete petition was filed. However, if the deadlines result
in a number of electric utilities filing cases within 45 days of each other, the presiding officers shall schedule
the cases in a manner to allow the commission to accommodate the workload of the cases irrespective of
whether such procedural schedule enables the commission to issue a final order in each of the cases within
one year after a materially complete petition is filed.

§25.237. Fuel Factors.
(a) Use and calculation of fuel factors. An electric utility’s fuel costs will be recovered from the electric
utility’s customers by the use of a fuel factor that will be charged for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumed
by the customer.
(1) An electric utility may determine its fuel factor in dollars per kilowatt-hour pursuant to either
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph. Fuel factors must account for system losses and for the
difference in line losses corresponding to the voltage at which the electric service is provided. An
electric utility may have different fuel factors for different times of the year to account for seasonal
variations. A different method of calculation may be allowed upon a showing of good cause by the
electric utility.
(A) Fuel factors may be determined by dividing the electric utility’s projected net eligible fuel
expenses, as defined in §25.236(a) of this title (relating to Recovery of Fuel Costs), by the
corresponding projected kilowatt-hour sales for the period in which the fuel factors are
expected to be in effect.
(B) Fuel factors may be determined using a commission-approved, utility-specific fuel factor
formula. Fuel factor formulas may be approved or revised only in a general rate change
proceeding or a proceeding to consider an application to establish a fuel factor formula
with notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
(2) An electric utility may initiate a change to its fuel factor as follows:
(A) Pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, an electric utility may petition to adjust its
fuel factor as often as once every four months according to the schedule set out in
subsection (d) of this section.
(B) Pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, an electric utility may petition to adjust its
fuel factor in accordance with its approved fuel factor formula no sooner than four months
after the filing of its most recent fuel factor adjustment petition.
(C) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section, an electric utility may petition to
change its fuel factor at times other than provided in the schedule if an emergency exists
as described in subsection (f) of this section.
(D) An electric utility’s fuel factor may be changed in any general rate proceeding.
(3) Fuel factors are temporary rates, and the electric utility’s collection of revenues by fuel factors is
subject to the following adjustments:
(A) The reasonableness of the fuel costs that an electric utility has incurred will be periodically
reviewed in a reconciliation proceeding, as described in §25.236 of this title, and any
disallowed costs resulting from a reconciliation proceeding will be reflected in the
calculation of the utility’s recoverable fuel and over/(under) collections.
(B) To the extent that there are variations between the fuel costs incurred and the revenues
collected, it may be necessary or convenient to refund overcollections or surcharge
undercollections. Refunds or surcharges may be made without changing an electric
utility’s fuel factor. Nothwithstanding §25.236(e)(6) of this title, an electric utility may
petition for a surcharge any time it has materially undercollected its fuel costs and projects
that it will continue to be in a state of material undercollection. Notwithstanding
§25.236(e)(6) of this title, an electric utility shall petition to make a refund any time it has
materially overcollected its fuel costs and projects that it will continue to be in a state of
material overcollection. “Materially” or “material,” as used in this section, shall mean that
the cumulative amount of over- or under-recovery, including interest, is greater than or
equal to 4.0% of the annual actual fuel cost figures on a rolling 12-month basis, as reflected
in the utility’s monthly fuel cost reports as filed by the utility with the commission.

(ii) any other items that to the knowledge of the electric utility have affected fuel
factor revenues and eligible fuel expenses; and
(iii) the difference, by customer class, between the revenues collected pursuant to fuel
factors and the eligible fuel expenses incurred.
(B) For each month of the period for which the revised fuel factors are expected to be in effect,
provide system energy input and sales, accompanied by the calculations underlying any
differentiation of fuel factors to account for differences in line losses corresponding to the
voltage at which the electric service is provided.
(2) An electric utility using the fuel factor formula methodology set forth under subsection (a)(1)(B) of
this section may file a petition requesting revised fuel factors pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(B) of
this section at least 15 days prior to the first billing cycle in the billing month in which the proposed
fuel factors are requested to become effective. A copy of the complete petition package shall be
served on each party in the utility’s most recent fuel reconciliation and on the Office of Public Utility
Counsel. Service shall be accomplished by email if possible. Each complete filing package shall
include:
(A) a tariff sheet reflecting the proposed fuel factors;

(C) calculations underlying any differentiation of fuel factors to account for differences in line
losses corresponding to the voltage at which the electric service is provided; and
(D) any computer generated documents must be provided in their native electronic format with
all cells and internal formulas disclosed.
(c) Fuel factor revision proceeding. Burden of proof and scope of proceeding are as follows:
(1) In a proceeding to revise fuel factors pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, an electric
utility has the burden of proving that:
(A) the expenses proposed to be recovered through the fuel factors are reasonable estimates of
the electric utility’s eligible fuel expenses during the period that the fuel factors are
expected to be in effect;
(B) the electric utility’s estimated monthly kilowatt-hour system sales and off-system sales are
reasonable estimates for the period that the fuel factors are expected to be in effect; and
(C) the proposed fuel factors are reasonably differentiated to account for line losses
corresponding to the voltage at which the electric service is provided.
(2) The scope of a fuel factor revision proceeding under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section is limited
to the issue of whether the petitioning electric utility has appropriately calculated its proposed fuel
factors. In a proceeding to revise fuel factors pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, an
electric utility has the burden of proving that:
(A) the electric utility has calculated its proposed fuel factors in compliance with the
commission-approved fuel factor formula; and

(2) Petitions by an electric utility to revise fuel factors pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section
may be filed in any month except December.
(e) Procedural schedules.
(1) Upon the filing of a petition to revise fuel factors pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section,
the presiding officer shall set a procedural schedule that will enable the commission to issue a final
order in the proceeding as follows:
(A) within 60 days after the petition was filed, if no hearing is requested within 30 days of the
petition; and
(B) within 90 days after the petition was filed, if a hearing is requested within 30 days of the
petition. If a hearing is requested, the hearing will be held no earlier than the first business
day after the 45th day after the application was filed.
(2) Upon the filing of a petition to revise fuel factors pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section,
the presiding officer shall set a procedural schedule as follows:
(A) the presiding officer shall issue an order approving the proposed fuel factors on an interim
basis no later than 12 days after the date the petition was filed, if no objection to interim

utility’s fixed fuel factor as defined in §25.237 of this title (relating to Fuel Factors).
(h) PCRF formula.
(1) The PCRF for each rate class must be calculated using the following formula:
PCRF = ({(((PPCCY + AACCY + APCM) * TRAFCY) - OSMCY) * CAFCY} – {(PPCRC-CLASS +
APCRC-CLASS - OSMRC-CLASS) * LGR} – {((PCICRC-CLASS * RORAT) + PCDEPRC-CLASS +
PCFITRC-CLASS + PCOTRC-CLASS) * LGI} + CTU) / CBDE
Where:
PPCCY = Cost-year purchased power capacity costs from entities that are not affiliates, in accordance
with subsection (c)(3) of this section.
AACCY = Cost-year purchased power capacity costs from entities that are affiliates and which costs
are incurred from agreements that have been pre-approved by the commission in a proceeding under
subsection (d) of this section as of the date of the filing of the instant PCRF application.
APCM = The lesser of:
• purchased power capacity costs from affiliates used to set base rates in the utility’s last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding, or
• cost-year purchased power capacity costs from affiliates less AACCY.
OSMCY = Cost-year margins from wholesale power capacity sales transactions.
TRAFCY = Cost-year value of the Texas retail jurisdiction production demand allocation factor,
using the same type of production demand allocation factor used to set rates in the utility’s last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding.

DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/19/2023
(P54844)
CAFCY = Cost-year value of the corresponding rate class production demand allocation factor, using
the same type of production demand allocation factor used to set rates in the utility’s last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
PPCRC-CLASS = Purchased power capacity costs from entities that are not affiliates, allocated to the
rate class and used to set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
APCRC-CLASS = Purchased power capacity costs from affiliates allocated to the rate class and used to
set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
OSMRC-CLASS = Margins from wholesale power capacity sales allocated to the rate class and used to
set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
LGR = The greater of (CBDCY / CBDRC) or 1.
CBDCY = Cost-year rate class billing determinants.
CBDRC = Rate class billing determinants used to calculate base rates from the utility’s last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
PCICRC-CLASS = Net production capacity invested capital allocated to the rate class and used to set
base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
RORAT = The after-tax rate of return used to set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive
base-rate proceeding.
PCDEPRC-CLASS = Depreciation expense, as related to gross production capacity, allocated to the rate
class and used to set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
PCFITRC-CLASS = Federal income tax, as related to net production capacity invested capital, allocated
to the rate class and used to set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
PCOTRC-CLASS = Other taxes, as related to net production capacity invested capital, allocated to the
rate class and used to set base rates from the utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding, and

(i) True-up. After establishment of an initial PCRF, a subsequent PCRF cost year is expected to contain
portions of two different PCRF rate years. Therefore, for purposes of calculating class over- or underrecoveries for use in a proceeding to adjust the PCRF, previous PCRF revenue requirements from PCRF rate
years in effect during the cost year must be prorated across the cost year. For each rate class, the difference
between the prorated cost-year PCRF revenue requirement that previous PCRFs were set to recover from
that class and the actual cost-year PCRF revenues recovered from that class, with interest on the balance
calculated at the rate established annually by the commission pursuant to §25.28(c) and (d) of this title
(relating to Bill Payment and Adjustments), must be credited or charged to that class when calculating the
adjusted PCRF. In the event that a PCRF rider is terminated, any over- or under-recovery amounts, with
interest applied, must be included in a separate rider.
(j) Reconciliation of PCRF expenses.
(1) The reasonableness and necessity of expenses recovered through the PCRF must be reviewed, and
such costs and corresponding PCRF revenues must be reconciled, as part of any proceeding initiated
under §25.236(b) of this title. Upon motion and showing of good cause, a PCRF reconciliation
proceeding may be severed from or consolidated with other proceedings.
(2) In a proceeding in which PCRF costs are being reconciled, the electric utility has the burden of
showing that:
(A) its expenses recovered through the PCRF during the reconciliation period were reasonable
and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable electric service to retail customers; and
(B) it has properly accounted for the amount of purchased power capacity-related revenues
collected pursuant to the PCRF and corresponding to costs reviewed during the
reconciliation period.
(3) Any refunds or surcharges resulting from a PCRF reconciliation, with interest applied, must, in the
annual PCRF proceeding immediately subsequent to the filing of the final order in the reconciliation
proceeding, be incorporated into the true-up balances described in subsection (i) of this section. In
the event that no PCRF rider is in effect subsequent to a PCRF reconciliation, such refunds or
surcharges, with interest applied, must be included in a separate rider.
(k) Transition Issues.
For a utility subject to a commission order to transition to retail competition as of the effective date of this
section, the utility’s existing power cost recovery factor in its tariff approved under the prior rule continues
to be effective until the effective date of new unbundled retail delivery tariffs for the utility, at which time
the power cost recovery factor must be terminated. Any over- or under-recovery amounts, with interest
applied, must be included in a separate rider to the utility’s retail delivery tariffs to be established in the
proceeding that approves such tariffs and must be credited or charged to customers as appropriate. The utility
must file monthly reports with the commission showing all such amounts until no remaining amounts remain
to be credited or charged, at which time the utility must file a final report with the commission.

§25.239. Transmission Cost Recovery Factor for Certain Electric Utilities.
(a) Application. The provisions of this section apply to an electric utility that operates solely outside of the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas in areas of Texas included in the Southwest Power Pool or the Western
Electricity Coordinating Council and that owns or operates transmission facilities.
(b) Definitions.
(1) Approved transmission charges (ATC) — Wholesale transmission charges approved by a federal
regulatory authority that are not being recovered through the electric utility’s other retail or
wholesale rates and that are appropriately allocated to Texas retail customers. The charges may
relate to the use of transmission facilities owned and operated by another transmission service
provider or regional transmission organization, including transmission-related administrative fees
but not including dispatch fees, congestion charges, costs incurred to hedge congestion charges, or
ancillary service charges.
(2) Transmission invested costs (TIC) — The net change in the electric utility’s transmission
investment costs including additions, upgrades, and retirements as booked in FERC accounts 350-
359, and accumulated depreciation.
(c) Recovery authorized. The commission, after notice and hearing, may allow an electric utility to recover its
reasonable and necessary costs for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale
transmission charges to the electric utility under a tariff approved by a federal regulatory authority to the
extent that the costs or charges have not otherwise been recovered and are incurred after December 31, 2005.
Any such recovery shall be made through the use of a transmission cost recovery factor (TCRF) approved by
an order of the commission. The TCRF shall be calculated pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. If a
utility has not had a base rate case with a final order issued after December 2005, the utility shall not be
eligible for recovery under this provision without first obtaining a final order in a base rate case.
(d) Transmission cost recovery factor (TCRF). The TCRF shall be determined by the following formula:
TCRF = RR * ClassALLOC
 BD
Where: TCRF = transmission cost recovery factor in dollars per unit, for billing each customer
class.
RR = transmission cost recovery factor revenue requirement, calculated pursuant to
subsection (e) of this section.
ClassALLOC = the customer class allocation factor used to allocate the transmission
revenue requirement in the utility’s most recent base rate case.
BD = each customer class’s annual billing determinant (kilowatt-hour, kilowatt, or
kilovolt-ampere) for the previous calendar year.

Effective 1/03/08
(e) Transmission cost recovery factor revenue requirement (RR). For an electric utility subject to this
section, the transmission cost recovery factor revenue requirement (RR) shall be calculated by using the
following formula:
RR = [revreqt + ATC]*ALLOC
Where: Revreqt = the sum of the return on TIC, net of accumulated depreciation and associated
accumulated deferred income taxes, plus investment-related expenses such as income
taxes, other associated taxes, depreciation, and transmission–related miscellaneous
revenue credits, but not including operation and maintenance expenses or administrative
expenses. The return on TIC shall be calculated by multiplying the TIC by the utility’s
weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as established for the utility in a final
commission order in a base rate case, provided that the order was filed within three years
prior to the initiation of the TCRF docket. Otherwise, a proxy WACC shall be used,
with a cost of equity of 10%; and the capital structure and cost of debt as reported in the
utility’s most recent Earnings Monitoring Report filed pursuant to §25.73 of this title
(relating to Financial and Operating Reports), adjusted for known and measurable
changes.
Transmission Invested Costs (TIC) is defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section.
Approved Transmission Charges (ATC) is defined in subsection (b)(1) of this section.
ALLOC = the utility’s Texas retail allocation of transmission revenue requirements, as
established in the utility’s most recent base rate case.
(f) Setting and amending the TCRF. An electric utility that is subject to this section may file an application
to set or amend a TCRF. The commission staff may also file an application to amend a TCRF. An electric
utility may not apply to amend its TCRF more frequently than once each calendar year, but a TCRF shall be
reviewed or amended at least once every three years. Upon completion of a base rate case for a utility, the
TCRF shall be set to zero. In a docket in which the TCRF is reviewed or amended, the commission may
order the refund of any previous over-recovery, but the commission shall not order the surcharge of any
under-recovery. An over-recovery shall be considered to have occurred if the revenues from the TCRF were
greater than the costs that the TCRF was intended to recover.
(g) TCRF forms. The commission may develop forms for TCRF applications and for monitoring the revenues
from a TCRF. If the commission develops and approves such forms, an electric utility shall use the forms as
required by the instructions accompanying the form.

§25.242. Arrangements Between Qualifying Facilities and Electric Utilities.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the arrangements between qualifying facilities, retail
electric providers with the price to beat obligation (PTB REPs), and electric utilities as required by federal
and state law in a manner consistent with the development of a competitive wholesale power market.
(b) Application. This section applies to all PTB REPs and to all electric utilities, including transmission and
distribution utilities. The provisions of this section concerning purchase or sale of electricity between an
electric utility and a qualifying facility do not apply to a transmission and distribution utility. This section
does not apply to municipal utilities, river authorities, or electric cooperatives.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
(1) Avoided costs -- The incremental costs to a PTB REP, or electric utility of electric energy, which,
but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or qualifying facilities, such PTB REP or electric
utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.
(2) Back-up power -- Electric energy or capacity supplied to replace energy or capacity ordinarily
generated by a qualifying facility’s own generation equipment during an unscheduled outage of the
qualifying facility.
(3) Cost of decremental energy -- The cost savings to a utility associated with the utility’s ability to
back-down some of its units or to avoid firing units, or to avoid purchases of power from another
source because of purchases of power from qualifying facilities.
(4) Electric utility -- For purposes of this section, an integrated investor-owned utility that has not
unbundled in accordance with Public Utility Regulatory Act §39.051.
(5) Firm power -- From a qualifying facility, power or power-producing capacity that is available
pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation for scheduled availability over a specified term.
(6) Host utility -- The utility with which the qualifying facility is directly interconnected.
(7) Maintenance power -- Electric energy or capacity supplied during scheduled outages of the
qualifying facility.
(8) Market price -- The market-clearing price of energy (MCPE) in the balancing energy market for
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) congestion zone in which the power is produced,
minus any administrative costs, including an appropriate share of ERCOT-assessed penalties and
fees typically applied to power generators.
(9) Non-firm power from a qualifying facility -- Power provided under an arrangement that does not
guarantee scheduled availability, but instead provides for delivery as available.
(10) Parallel operation -- A mode of operation which enables a qualifying facility to export
automatically any electric capacity which is not consumed by the qualifying facility or the user of
the qualifying facility’s output. Parallel operation results in three possible states of operation at any
point in time:
(A) The qualifying facility is generating an amount of capacity that is less than the customer’s
load. The customer is therefore a net consumer.
(B) The qualifying facility is generating an amount of capacity that is more than the customer’s
load. The customer is therefore a net producer.
(C) The qualifying facility is generating an amount of capacity that is equal to the customer’s
load. The customer is therefore neither a net producer nor a net consumer.
(11) Purchase -- The purchase of electric energy or capacity or both from a qualifying facility by a PTB
REP or electric utility.
(12) Purchasing utility -- The electric utility that is purchasing a qualifying facility’s capacity and/or
energy.

(A) In accordance with this subsection and subsection (g) of this section, each PTB REP and
electric utility shall purchase any energy that is made available from a qualifying facility:
(i) directly to the PTB REP or electric utility; or
(ii) indirectly to the PTB REP or electric utility in accordance with paragraph (4) of
this subsection.
(B) Each electric utility shall purchase energy from a qualifying facility with a design capacity
of 100 kilowatts or more within 90 days of being notified by the qualifying facility that
such energy is or will be available, provided that the electric utility has sufficient
interconnection facilities available. If an agreement to purchase energy is not reached
within 90 days after the qualifying facility provides such notification, the agreement, if and
when achieved, shall bear a retroactive effective date for the purchase of energy delivered
to the electric utility correspondent with the 90th day following such notice. If the electric
utility determines that adequate interconnection facilities are not available, the electric
utility shall inform the qualifying facility within 30 days after being notified for distribution
interconnection, or within 60 days for transmission interconnection, giving the qualifying
facility a description of the additional facilities required as well as cost and schedule
estimates for construction of such facilities. If an agreement to purchase energy is not
reached upon completion of construction of the interconnection facilities or 90 days after
notification by the qualifying facility that such energy is or will be available, the agreement,
if and when achieved, shall bear a retroactive effective date for the purchase of energy
delivered to the electric utility correspondent with the time of interconnection or the 90th
day, whichever is later. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed in a manner that 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 1/08/09
would preclude a qualifying facility from notifying and contracting for energy with a utility
for sale of energy prior to 90 days before delivery of such energy.
(C) Each PTB REP shall purchase energy from a qualifying facility with a design capacity of
100 kilowatts or more within a timely fashion after being notified by the qualifying facility
that such energy is or will be available.
(2) Obligation to sell to qualifying facilities. In accordance with subsection (k) of this section, each
electric utility shall sell any energy and capacity requested to any qualifying facility located within
the electric utility’s service area. Each PTB REP shall also sell any energy requested to any
qualifying facility; however, those sales shall be at market based rates. Nothing shall restrict the
ability of any qualifying facility to purchase energy from any REP.
(3) Interconnection. Interconnection by a qualifying facility is addressed by Subchapter I, Division 1,
of this chapter (relating to Transmission and Distribution) if the interconnection is to a transmission
system and by §25.211 of this title (relating to Interconnection of On-site Distributed Generation)
if the interconnection is to a distribution system, except if the interconnection is regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
(4) Transmission to other electric utilities. Transmission service provided by an electric utility in the
ERCOT power region to a qualifying facility shall be governed by Subchapter I of this chapter.
(5) PTB REP and scheduling with qualifying facilities. A PTB REP shall use dynamic resource
scheduling or responsibility transfer in ERCOT with any qualifying facility that requests such
scheduling, as permitted by ERCOT. The PTB REP’s cost of using dynamic resource scheduling
or responsibility transfer attributable solely to purchases from qualifying facilities shall be charged
to qualifying facilities that use such scheduling. If a qualifying facility uses static scheduling, the
qualifying facility shall bear the costs for any imbalances resulting from the qualifying facility’s
failure to submit a schedule or to comply with the schedule.
(g) Rates for purchases from a qualifying facility.
(1) Rates for purchases of energy and capacity from any qualifying facility shall be just and reasonable
to the customers of the electric utility or PTB REP and in the public interest, and shall not
discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.
(2) Rates for purchases of energy and capacity from any qualifying facility shall not exceed avoided
cost. Rates for purchase shall be based upon a market-based determination of avoided costs over
the specific term of the contract or other legally enforceable obligation, the rates for such purchase
do not violate this subsection if the rates for such purchase differ from avoided cost at the time of
delivery. Payments which do not exceed avoided cost shall be found to be just and reasonable
operating expenses of the electric utility.
(3) A QF may agree to commit, on a day-ahead basis, to deliver firm power for the next day to a PTB
REP. Rates for purchase of this power shall be based on prices for the day that the power was
actually delivered as reported or published in an independent third party index or survey of trades
of commonly traded power products in ERCOT, provided that the index or survey is ERCOTspecific and is based upon enough transactions to represent a liquid market, and the commitment to
deliver shall correspond with the relevant hours of delivery of those products.
(h) Standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less.
(1) There shall be included in the tariffs of each electric utility standard rates for purchases from
qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less. The rates for purchases under
this paragraph:
(A) shall be consistent with subsection (g) of this section, as it concerns purchases from a
qualifying facility;
(B) shall consider the aggregate capacity value provided by multiple qualifying facilities with
a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less; and
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 1/08/09
(C) may differentiate among qualifying facilities using various technologies on the basis of the
supply characteristics of the different technologies.
(2) Terms and conditions unique to qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less
such as metering arrangements, safety equipment requirements, liability for injury or equipment
damage, access to equipment and additional administrative costs, if any, shall be included in a
standard tariff.
(3) The standard tariff shall offer at least the following options:
(A) parallel operation with interconnection through a single meter that measures net
consumption;
(i) net consumption for a given billing period shall be billed in accordance with the
standard tariff applicable to the customer class to which the user of the qualifying
facility’s output belongs;
(ii) net production will not be metered or purchased by the utility and therefore there
will be no additional customer charge imposed on the qualifying facility;
(B) parallel operation with interconnection through two meters with one measuring net
consumption and the other measuring net production;
(i) net consumption for a given billing period shall be billed in accordance with the
standard tariff applicable to the customer class to which the user of the qualifying
facility’s output belongs;
(ii) net production for a given billing period shall be purchased at the standard rate
provided for in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection;
(C) interconnection through two meters with one measuring all consumption by the customer
and the other measuring all production by the qualifying facility;
(i) all consumption by the customer for a given billing period shall be billed in
accordance with the standard tariff applicable to the customer class to which the
customer would belong in the absence of the qualifying facility;
(ii) all production by the qualifying facility for a given billing period shall be
purchased at the standard rate provided for in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this
subsection.
(4) In addition, each electric utility shall offer qualifying facilities using renewable resources with an
aggregate design capacity of 50 kilowatts or less the option of interconnecting through a single meter
that runs forward and backward.
(A) Any consumption for a given billing period shall be billed in accordance with the standard
tariff applicable to the customer class to which the user of the qualifying facility’s output
belongs.
(B) Any production for a given billing period shall be purchased at the standard rate provided
for in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.
(C) This option is not available if a contract for interconnection or the purchase of electricity
is executed after December 31, 2008.
(5) Interconnection requirements necessary to permit interconnected operations between the qualifying
facility and the utility and the costs associated with such requirements shall be dealt with in a manner
consistent with Subchapter I of this chapter.
(6) The rates, terms and conditions contained in the standard tariff for qualifying facilities with a design
capacity of 100 kilowatts or less shall be subject to review and revision by the commission.
(7) Except for qualifying facilities subject to §25.217 of this title (relating to Distributed Renewable
Generation) requirements for the provision of insurance under this subsection shall be of a type
commonly available from insurance carriers in the region of the state where the customer is located
and for the classification to which the customer would belong in the absence of the qualifying facility.
An enhancement to a standard homeowner’s or farm and ranch owner’s policy containing adequate

Effective 1/08/09
liability coverage and having the effect of adding the electric utility as an additional insured or named
insured is one means of satisfying the requirements of this paragraph. Such policies shall in each
instance be on a form approved or promulgated by the Texas Department of Insurance and issued by
a property or casualty insurer licensed to do business in the State of Texas.
(i) Tariffs setting out the methodologies for purchases of nonfirm power from a qualifying facility. Tariffs
setting out the methodologies for purchases of nonfirm power from a qualifying facility shall be filed with
the commission based on one of the following approaches:
(1) Rates for purchases of nonfirm power may, by agreement of both the electric utility and the
qualifying facility, be based on the utility’s average avoided energy costs. Administrative, billing,
and metering costs shall be recovered through a monthly customer charge to the qualifying facility.
(2) PTB REPs and QFs may mutually agree to rates for purchases of nonfirm power that differ from the
rates described in paragraph (4) of this subsection. Any such agreements shall be made on a
nondiscriminatory basis. Such agreements may include provisions to prevent the potential for
arbitrage.
(3) Rates for purchases of nonfirm power may, at the option of the qualifying facility, be based on the
full cost at the time of delivery of decremental energy that would have been incurred by the electric
utility had the qualifying facility not been in operation.
(A) The following factors should be considered in the calculation of the cost of decremental
energy:
(i) fuel costs;
(ii) variable operating and maintenance costs;
(iii) line losses;
(iv) heat rates;
(v) cost of purchases from other sources;
(vi) other energy-related costs;
(vii) capacity costs, if, as a class, qualifying facilities providing nonfirm energy offer
some predictable capacity; and
(viii) for short term energy purchases, the time and quantity of energy furnished.
(B) If practical, the avoided cost should be determined by calculating by time period, using the
utility’s economic dispatch model (or comparable methodology), the difference between
the cost of the total energy furnished by both the qualifying facility and the utility,
computed as though the energy furnished by the qualifying facility had been furnished by
the utility, and the actual cost of energy furnished by the utility.
(C) The economic dispatch model should take into consideration the following factors:
(i) fuel costs;
(ii) variable operating and maintenance costs;
(iii) line losses;
(iv) heat rates;
(v) purchased power opportunity;
(vi) system stability; and
(vii) operating characteristics.
(D) Time periods should be hourly if the utility has an automated economic dispatch model
available; otherwise the shortest reasonable time period for which costs can be determined
should be used.
(E) Administrative, billing, and metering costs shall be recovered through a monthly customer
charge to the qualifying facility.
(4) Rates for purchases of nonfirm power shall be based on the market price of energy at the time of
sale from the QF unless other arrangements have been made in accordance with paragraph (2) of
this subsection. Administrative, billing, and metering costs shall be recovered through a monthly 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.

DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 1/08/09
customer charge to the qualifying facility. Such agreements may include provisions to prevent the
potential for arbitrage.
(j) Periods during which purchases not required.
(1) Any PTB REP or electric utility which gives notice to each affected qualifying facility in time for
the qualifying facility to cease delivery of energy or capacity to the PTB REP, or electric utility
will not be required to purchase electric energy or capacity during any period during which, due to
operational circumstances, including resource ramp rate limitations that could cause imbalances or
the amount of energy put by the QF exceeds the PTB REP’s load, purchases from qualifying
facilities will result in costs greater than those which the electric utility would incur if it did not
make such purchases, but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy itself, provided,
however, that this subsection does not override contractual obligations of the PTB REP or electric
utility to purchase from a qualifying facility.
(2) Any PTB REP or electric utility which fails to give notice to each affected qualifying facility in time
for the qualifying facility to cease the delivery of energy or capacity to the PTB REP or electric
utility will be required to pay the same rate for such purchase of energy or capacity as would be
required had the period of greater costs not occurred.
(3) A claim by PTB REP or an electric utility that such a period has occurred or will occur is subject to
such verification by the commission either before or after the occurrence.
(k) Rates for sales to qualifying facilities.
(1) General rules.
(A) Rates for sales to qualifying facilities shall be just and reasonable and in the public interest,
and shall not discriminate against any qualifying facility in comparison to rates for sales to
other customers served by the electric utility. Rates for standby or other supplementary
service shall be based on the amount of capacity contracted for between the qualifying
facility and the electric utility, and shall not penalize electric utilities that also purchase
power from qualifying facilities. The need for and cost responsibility for special equipment
or system modifications shall be determined by application of Subchapter I of this chapter.
(B) Rates for sales that are based on accurate data and consistent system-wide costing
principles shall not be considered to discriminate against any qualifying facility to the
extent that such rates apply to the electric utility’s other customers with similar load or
other cost-related characteristics.
(2) Additional services to be provided to qualifying facilities.
(A) Upon request of a qualifying facility within its service area, each electric utility shall
provide:
(i) supplementary power;
(ii) back-up power;
(iii) maintenance power; and
(iv) interruptible power.
(B) An electric utility shall not be required to provide supplementary power, back-up power,
or maintenance power to a qualifying facility if the commission finds that provision of such
power will:
(i) impair the electric utility’s ability to render adequate service to its customers; or
(ii) place an undue burden on the electric utility.
(3) Rates for sales of back-up power and maintenance power. The rate for sales of back-up power or
maintenance power:
(A) shall not be based upon an assumption (unless supported by factual data) that forced
outages or other reductions in electric output by all qualifying facilities on an electric
utility’s system will occur simultaneously, or during the system peak, or both; and
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 1/08/09
(B) shall take into account the extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facilities
can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the utility’s facilities.
(l) System emergencies.
(1) Qualifying facility obligation to provide power during system emergencies. A qualifying
facility shall be required to provide energy or capacity to an electric utility during a system
emergency only to the extent:
(A) provided by agreement between such qualifying facility and electric utility; or
(B) ordered under the Federal Power Act, §202(c).
(2) Discontinuance of purchases and sales during system emergencies. During any system
emergency, an electric utility may discontinue:
(A) purchases from a qualifying facility if such purchases would contribute to such emergency;
and
(B) sales to a qualifying facility, provided that such discontinuance is on a nondiscriminatory
basis.
(m) Enforcement. A proceeding to resolve a dispute between an electric utility, PTB REP and a qualifying
facility arising under this section may be instituted by filing of a petition with the commission. Electric
utilities, PTB REPs, and qualifying facilities are encouraged to engage in alternative dispute resolution prior
to the filing of a complaint.

PURA §36.053, that are categorized as distribution plant, distribution-related intangible plant, and
distribution-related communication equipment and networks properly recorded in Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) Uniform System of Accounts 303, 352, 353, 360 through 374, 391,
and 397. Distribution invested capital includes only costs: for plant that has been placed into
service; that comply with PURA, including §36.053 and §36.058; and that are prudent, reasonable,
and necessary. Distribution invested capital does not include: generation-related costs;
transmission-related costs, including costs recovered through rates set pursuant to §25.192 of this
title (relating to Transmission Service Rates), §25.193 of this title (relating to Distribution Service
Provider Transmission Cost Recovery Factors (TCRF)), or §25.239 of this title (relating to
Transmission Cost Recovery Factor for Certain Electric Utilities); indirect corporate costs;
capitalized operations and maintenance expenses; and distribution invested capital recovered
through a separate rate, including a surcharge, tracker, rider, or other mechanism. In a DCRF
proceeding, an electric utility may elect not to seek recovery of certain distribution invested capital,
but may not exclude all of the distribution invested capital in one of the accounts identified above
unless the electric utility can prove that the distribution invested capital in the account reduced by
the related accumulated depreciation is greater than the distribution invested capital in the account
reduced by the related accumulated depreciation used in setting rates in the electric utility’s last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
(4) Net distribution invested capital -- Distribution invested capital less accumulated depreciation and
adjusted for any changes in distribution-related accumulated deferred federal income taxes and
excluding any impact associated with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48
(FIN 48).
(5) Weather-normalized -- Adjusted for normal weather using weather data for the most recent ten
calendar years.
(c) Application for a DCRF.
(1) General requirements.
(A) Filing of application. An electric utility may apply for inclusion of a DCRF in its tariffs
for wholesale and retail distribution service. To implement a DCRF, an electric utility shall
file the application for the DCRF simultaneously with all regulatory authorities having
original jurisdiction over the electric utility’s distribution service area.
(B) Municipal proceedings. A municipality’s governing body with original jurisdiction over
an application for a DCRF shall make a final decision on the application within 60 days
after the application was filed. If the governing body does not make a final decision within
60 days after the application was filed, the application is deemed denied by the governing

CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 10/13/11
the governing body’s final decision to the commission, regardless of whether the governing
body approves or denies the application, and the appeal is deemed at that time to be
consolidated with the electric utility’s DCRF proceeding before the commission. In
addition, the governing body’s interim and final decisions are deemed automatically
suspended at the times they took effect.
(C) Frequency of DCRF proceedings. An electric utility may have no more than one DCRF
(including a DCRF amendment) become effective each calendar year pursuant to an
application filed pursuant to this paragraph. An electric utility may change its rates
pursuant to a DCRF no more than four times between comprehensive base-rate
proceedings. An electric utility shall not apply for a DCRF while a comprehensive baserate proceeding for the electric utility is pending. In addition, the presiding officer shall
dismiss an electric utility’s application for a DCRF if the electric utility or commission
initiates a comprehensive base-rate proceeding within 145 days after the electric utility
filed the application for a DCRF.
(2) Requirements applicable to TDUs. A TDU may file an application for a DCRF only during the
period April 1 through April 8. A TDU shall not file an application for a DCRF after April 8 of a
year even if April 8 is not a working day, as defined by §22.2(44) of this title (relating to
Definitions).
(3) Requirements applicable to other electric utilities. An electric utility that does not offer customer
choice may file an application for a DCRF at any time other than in April and May.
(d) Calculation of DCRF.
(1) DCRF formula. The DCRF for each rate class shall be calculated using the following formula:
[((DICC - DICRC) * RORAT) + (DEPRC – DEPRRC) + (FITC – FITRC) + (OTC – OTRC) –
∑(DISTREVRC-CLASS * %GROWTHCLASS)] * ALLOCCLASS / BDC-CLASS
Where:
DICC = Current Net Distribution Invested Capital.
DICRC = Net Distribution Invested Capital from the last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
RORAT = After-Tax Rate of Return as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
DEPRC = Current Depreciation Expense, as related to Current Gross Distribution Invested Capital,
calculated using the currently approved depreciation rates.
DEPRRC = Depreciation Expense, as related to Gross Distribution Invested Capital, from the last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
FITC = Current Federal Income Tax, as related to Current Net Distribution Invested Capital, including the
change in federal income taxes related to the change in return on rate base and synchronization of interest
associated with the change in rate base resulting from additions to and retirements of distribution plant as
used to compute Net Distribution Invested Capital.
FITRC = Federal Income Tax, as related to Net Distribution Invested Capital from the last comprehensive
base-rate proceeding.
OTC = Current Other Taxes (taxes other than income taxes and taxes associated with the return on rate
base), as related to Current Net Distribution Invested Capital, calculated using current tax rates and the
methodology from the last comprehensive base-rate proceeding, and not including municipal franchise fees.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE

DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 10/13/11
OTRC = Other Taxes, as related to Net Distribution Invested Capital from the last comprehensive base-rate
proceeding, and not including municipal franchise fees.
DISTREVRC-CLASS (Distribution Revenues by rate class based on Net Distribution Invested Capital from the
last comprehensive base-rate proceeding) = (DICRC-CLASS * RORAT) + DEPRRC-CLASS + FITRC-CLASS + OTRCCLASS.
%GROWTHCLASS (Growth in Billing Determinants by Class) = (BDC-CLASS – BDRC-CLASS) / BDRC-CLASS
DICRC-CLASS = Net Distribution Invested Capital allocated to the rate class from the last comprehensive
base-rate proceeding.
DEPRRC-CLASS = Depreciation Expense, as related to Gross Distribution Invested Capital, allocated to the rate class in
the last comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
FITRC-CLASS = Federal Income Tax, as related to Net Distribution Invested Capital, allocated to the rate class in the last
comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
OTRC-CLASS = Other Taxes, as related to Net Distribution Invested Capital, allocated to the rate class in the
last comprehensive base-rate proceeding, and not including municipal franchise fees.
ALLOCCLASS = Rate Class Allocation Factor approved in the last comprehensive base-rate proceeding,
calculated as: total net distribution plant allocated to rate class, divided by total net distribution plant. For
situations in which data from the last comprehensive base-rate proceeding are not available to perform the
described calculation, the Rate Class Allocation Factor shall be calculated as the total distribution revenue
requirement allocated to the rate class (less any identifiable amounts explicitly unrelated to Distribution
Invested Capital) divided by the total distribution revenue requirement (less any identifiable amounts
explicitly unrelated to Distribution Invested Capital) for all classes as approved by the commission in the
electric utility’s last comprehensive base-rate case.
BDC-CLASS = Rate Class Billing Determinants (weather-normalized and adjusted to reflect the number of
customers at the end of the period) for the 12 months ending on the date used for purposes of determining
the Current Net Distribution Invested Capital. For customer classes billed primarily on the basis of kilowatthour billing determinants, the DCRF shall be calculated using kilowatt-hour billing determinants. For
customer classes billed primarily on the basis of demand billing determinants, the DCRF shall be calculated
using demand billing determinants.
BDRC-CLASS = Rate Class Billing Determinants used to set rates in the last comprehensive base-rate
proceeding.
If an input to the DCRF formula from the last comprehensive base-rate proceeding is not separately
identified in that proceeding, it shall be derived from information from that proceeding.
(2) Return on invested capital. The electric utility’s rate of return is the rate of return approved by
the commission in the electric utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding if the final order
(which may be an order on rehearing) approving the rate of return was filed less than three years
before the application for a DCRF was filed. If the final order approving the rate of return was filed
three years or more before the application for a DCRF was filed, the rate of return is the lesser of
the rate of return in the final order or the alternative rate of return calculated as follows: The
alternative rate of return shall be calculated using a 10% cost of equity, the capital structure approved
by the commission in the electric utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding, and the cost of
debt as reported in the electric utility’s most recent Earnings Monitoring Report filed pursuant to
§25.73 of this title (relating to Financial and Operating Reports).

(3) Determination of Distribution Invested Capital. The electric utility must clearly identify any
costs included as distribution invested capital because of a change in accounting rules or practices
since the test year in the electric utility’s most recent comprehensive base-rate proceeding. The
commission shall exclude such costs if the electric utility does not prove that the costs are
appropriate for recovery through the DCRF.
(e) Procedures for DCRF proceeding.
(1) Filing requirements. To file an application for a DCRF, an electric utility shall use the commissionprescribed form and include a sworn statement from an appropriate employee of the electric utility
that the application complies with the electric utility’s tariff and this section, including that the
distribution invested capital in the application includes only costs: for plant that has been placed
into service; that comply with PURA, including §36.053 and §36.058; and that are prudent,
reasonable, and necessary. In addition, the sworn statement shall state that the application is true
and correct to the best of the employee’s knowledge, information, and belief. Furthermore, the
electric utility shall include in its application an earnings monitoring report for the immediately
preceding calendar year prepared in accordance with §25.73(b) of this title.
(2) Notice and intervention deadline. By the day after it files its application, the electric utility shall
provide notice of its application, using a reasonable method of notice, to all parties in the electric
utility’s last comprehensive base-rate proceeding and, if applicable, last DCRF proceeding, and shall
include in the notice the docket number for the new proceeding. The intervention deadline is 30
days from the date service of notice is completed.
(3) Parties. The Office of Public Utility Counsel and affected parties may participate as parties in a
DCRF proceeding.
(4) Denial due to earnings. The commission shall deny an electric utility’s application for a DCRF if
the earnings monitoring report included in the electric utility’s application shows that the electric
utility is earning more than its authorized rate of return using weather-normalized data. In making
this determination, the commission shall correct the calculation of the earned rate of return in the
earnings monitoring report to the extent that the calculation does not comply with §25.73(b) of this
title and any form adopted to implement that subsection.
(5) Scope of proceeding. The issues of whether distribution invested capital included in an application
for a DCRF or DCRF adjustment complies with PURA, including §36.053 and §36.058, and is
prudent, reasonable, and necessary shall not be addressed in a DCRF proceeding unless the presiding
officer finds that good cause exists to address these issues.
(6) Commission processing of application.
(A) Sufficiency of application. A motion to find an application materially deficient shall be
filed no later than 30 days after service of notice is completed. The motion shall be served
on the electric utility by hand delivery, facsimile transmission, or overnight courier
delivery, or by e-mail if agreed to by the electric utility or ordered by the presiding officer.
The motion shall specify the nature of the deficiency and the relevant portions of the
application, and cite the particular requirement with which the application is alleged not to
comply. The electric utility’s response to a motion to find an application materially
deficient shall be filed no later than five working days after such motion is received. If
within ten working days after the deadline for filing a motion to find an application
materially deficient, the presiding officer has not issued a written order concluding that
material deficiencies exist in the application, the application is deemed sufficient.
(B) Discovery. Each party, other than commission staff, may serve no more than 20 requests
for information and requests for admissions of fact pursuant to §22.144 of this title (relating
to Requests for Information and Requests for Admission of Facts), except where the
presiding officer finds good cause for a party to serve additional requests. Except for a
request by commission staff, a request shall not include subparts or multiple questions, and 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 10/13/11
requests shall be sequentially numbered, regardless of whether the requests are served at
the same time or on different parties. A response to a request shall be served no later than
ten working days after receipt of the discovery request. An objection to a request shall be
filed no later than five working days from receipt of the request. A request for which an
objection is filed does not count towards a party’s request limit. A party may request a
technical conference by the intervention deadline, and shall identify the topics that it wants
to discuss. An electric utility shall hold the technical conference in Austin, Texas five
working days after the intervention deadline, unless the electric utility and the parties who
requested the technical conference agree to a different date. The technical conference shall
be held at the location designated by the electric utility, unless the commission staff
designates a location. The electric utility shall have appropriate persons attend the
technical conference to answer questions. A party may take a deposition only if authorized
by the presiding officer.
(C) System-wide rates and effective date of DCRF. The presiding officer shall approve the
DCRF for an electric utility on a system-wide basis and set the effective date of the DCRF
for a TDU as September 1 unless good cause exists for a later date. The presiding officer
shall make a final decision on a DCRF application made by a TDU at least 46 days before
the effective date of the approved rates, even if this requirement results in an effective date
after September 1. For an electric utility that does not offer customer choice, the presiding
officer shall set the effective date of the DCRF to be 145 days after the application was
filed unless good cause exists for a later date.
(D) Review of application. A DCRF proceeding is eligible for disposition pursuant to
§22.35(b)(1) of this title (relating to Informal Disposition).
(E) Notice of approved rates. Unless otherwise ordered, a TDU shall serve notice of the
approved rates and the effective date of the approved rates by the working day after the
presiding officer’s final decision, to retail electric providers that are authorized by the
registration agent to provide service in the TDU’s distribution service area. Notice under
this subparagraph of this paragraph may be served by email.
(f) DCRF reconciliation. The commission shall reconcile investments recovered through a DCRF in the
electric utility’s next comprehensive base-rate proceeding to the extent such reconciliation did not already
occur in a DCRF proceeding pursuant to subsection (e)(5) of this section. The reconciliation shall be limited
to the issues of the extent to which the investments complied with PURA, including §36.053 and §36.058,
and this section and were prudent, reasonable, and necessary. To the extent that the commission determines
that the investments did not comply with PURA and this section or were not prudent, reasonable, and
necessary, the electric utility shall refund all revenues related to the investments that it improperly recovered
through rates, and shall also pay its customers carrying charges on these revenues. The carrying charges
shall be determined as follows: For the time period beginning with the date on which over-recovery is
determined to have begun to the effective date of the new base rates, carrying costs shall be calculated using
the same rate of return that was applied to the investments in the DCRF proceedings that resulted in the overrecovery. For the time period beginning with the effective date of the new base rates, carrying costs shall be
calculated using the electric utility’s rate of return authorized in the comprehensive base-rate proceeding.
(g) DCRF’s effect on electric utility’s financial risk and rate of return. In setting the rate of return for an
electric utility with a DCRF, the commission may expressly consider the effect of the DCRF on the electric
utility’s financial risk and rate of return.
(h) Reports. An electric utility with a DCRF shall file reports that will permit the commission to monitor its
DCRF revenues, in accordance with any filing requirements and schedules prescribed by the commission
pursuant to §25.73 of this title or this section.

§25.244. Billing Demand for Certain Utility Customers.
(a) Application. This section applies to a transmission and distribution utility (TDU) that provides retail
distribution service.
(b) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings, unless the context
indicates otherwise.
(1) Demand ratchet -- A provision in a TDU’s tariff for retail distribution service that allows a
customer to be billed based on the greater of the peak demand by that customer in the current month
or some fixed percentage of the peak demand for that customer during previous months.
(2) Nonresidential secondary voltage service customer -- A nonresidential customer that is billed
demand charges for retail distribution service and that receives retail distribution service at
secondary voltage through one point of delivery and that is measured using one meter.
(c) Rates. In a proceeding in which base rates are set for nonresidential secondary voltage service customers,
the base rates set for nonresidential secondary voltage service customers shall provide that these customers
shall be billed on a kilowatt-hour (kWh), kilowatt (kW), or kilovolt-amperes (kVA) basis, and that if a
demand ratchet is utilized, the demand ratchet shall not apply to a nonresidential secondary voltage service
customer that has an annual load factor less than or equal to 25 percent. This subsection does not require the
use of demand ratchets for any customers. This subsection shall not be applied in a manner that would shift
costs to other customer classes.
(d) Annual Verification. Upon the implementation of base rates consistent with subsection (c) of this section,
a TDU shall determine annually for each of its nonresidential secondary service customers whether to apply
a demand ratchet. In addition, by January 15 of each year following the commission’s final order in a
proceeding described by subsection (c) of this section, a TDU shall file an affidavit certifying that it has
accurately identified and billed nonresidential secondary service customers who under subsection (c) of this
section cannot be charged a demand ratchet. In addition, the TDU shall attach to the affidavit a thorough
description of the procedures that it uses to ensure that these customers are accurately identified and billed.

§25.245. Rate-Case Expenses.
(a) Application. This section applies to utilities requesting recovery of expenses for ratemaking proceedings
(rate-case expenses) pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §36.061(b)(2) and to municipalities
requesting reimbursement for rate-case expenses pursuant to PURA §33.023(b).
(b) Requirements for claiming recovery of or reimbursement for rate-case expenses. A utility or
municipality requesting recovery of or reimbursement for its rate-case expenses shall have the burden to
prove the reasonableness of such rate-case expenses by a preponderance of the evidence. A utility or
municipality seeking recovery of or reimbursement for rate-case expenses shall file sufficient information
that details and itemizes all rate-case expenses, including, but not limited to, evidence verified by testimony
or affidavit, showing:
(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the work done by the attorney or other professional in the rate
case;
(2) the time and labor required and expended by the attorney or other professional;
(3) the fees or other consideration paid to the attorney or other professional for the services rendered;
(4) the expenses incurred for lodging, meals and beverages, transportation, or other services or
materials;
(5) the nature and scope of the rate case, including:
(A) the size of the utility and number and type of consumers served;
(B) the amount of money or value of property or interest at stake;
(C) the novelty or complexity of the issues addressed;
(D) the amount and complexity of discovery;
(E) the occurrence and length of a hearing; and
(6) the specific issue or issues in the rate case and the amount of rate-case expenses reasonably
associated with each issue.
(c) Criteria for review and determination of reasonableness. In determining the reasonableness of the ratecase expenses, the presiding officer shall consider the relevant factors listed in subsection (b) of this section
and any other factor shown to be relevant to the specific case. The presiding officer shall decide whether and
the extent to which the evidence shows that:
(1) the fees paid to, tasks performed by, or time spent on a task by an attorney or other professional
were extreme or excessive;
(2) the expenses incurred for lodging, meals and beverages, transportation, or other services or materials
were extreme or excessive;
(3) there was duplication of services or testimony;
(4) the utility’s or municipality’s proposal on an issue in the rate case had no reasonable basis in law,
policy, or fact and was not warranted by any reasonable argument for the extension, modification,
or reversal of commission precedent;
(5) rate-case expenses as a whole were disproportionate, excessive, or unwarranted in relation to the
nature and scope of the rate case addressed by the evidence pursuant to subsection (b)(5) of this
section; or
(6) the utility or municipality failed to comply with the requirements for providing sufficient
information pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
(d) Calculation of allowed or disallowed rate-case expenses.
(1) Based on the factors and criteria in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the presiding officer shall
allow or recommend allowance of recovery of rate-case expenses equal to the amount shown in the
evidentiary record to have been actually and reasonably incurred by the requesting utility or
municipality. The presiding officer shall disallow or recommend disallowance of recovery of rate-

(P 41622)
case expenses equal to the amount shown to have been not reasonably incurred under the criteria in
subsection (c) of this section. A disallowance may be based on cost estimates in lieu of actual costs
if reasonably accurate and supported by the evidence.
(2) A disallowance pursuant to subsection (c)(5) of this section may be calculated as a proportion of a
utility’s or municipality’s requested rate-case expenses using the following methodology or any
other appropriate methodology:
(A) For utilities, the ratio of:
(i) the amount of the increase in revenue requirement requested by the utility that
was denied, to
(ii) the total amount of the increase in revenue requirement requested in a
proceeding by the utility.
(B) For municipalities, the ratio of:
(i) the amount of the increase in revenue requirement requested by the utility
unsuccessfully challenged by the municipality, to
(ii) the total amount of the increase in revenue requirement challenged by the
municipality.
(3) If the evidence presented pursuant to subsection (b)(6) of this section does not enable the presiding
officer to determine the appropriate disallowance of rate-case expenses reasonably associated with
an issue with certainty and specificity, then the presiding officer may disallow or deny recovery of
a proportion of a utility’s or municipality’s requested rate-case expenses using the following
methodology or any other appropriate methodology:
(A) For utilities, the ratio of:
(i) the amount of the increase in revenue requirement requested by the utility in the
rate case related to the issue(s) not reasonably supported by evidence of certainty
and specificity, to
(ii) the total amount of the increase in revenue requirement requested in a proceeding
by the utility.
(B) For municipalities, the ratio of:
(i) the amount of the increase in revenue requirement requested by the utility in the
rate case challenged by the municipality relating to the issue(s) not reasonably
supported by evidence of certainty and specificity, to
(ii) the total amount of the increase in revenue requirement challenged by the
municipality.

§25.246. Rate Filing Standards and Procedures for Non-ERCOT Utilities.
(a) Application. The provisions of this section apply only to an electric utility that operates solely outside of
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
(b) Adjustments to test year information.
(1) Definitions.
(A) Test year -- The period defined in §25.5(134) of this title (relating to Definitions).
(B) Update period -- For a utility that elects to file under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection,
the period beyond the end of the test year, for which period the electric utility initially
submits estimated information and later submits actual information to be used in
establishing its base rates. The update period chosen by the utility must end on the last day
of a calendar or fiscal year quarter, and not later than the 30th day before the date the
applicable rate proceeding is filed.
(2) Test year election. In establishing the base rates of an electric utility under the Public Utility
Regulatory Act (PURA), Chapter 36, Subchapter C or D, the commission shall determine the
utility’s revenue requirement based on, at the election of the utility:
(A) information submitted for a test year; or
(B) information submitted for a test year updated to include actual information for the update
period regarding increases and decreases in the utility’s cost of service, including expenses,
capital investment, cost of capital, and sales.
(3) Requirements for test year update. The updated information authorized to be submitted by
paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection shall be subject to the following additional standards:
(A) expenses authorized by §25.231(b) of this title (relating to Cost of Service) for inclusion in
revenue requirement shall reflect the 12-month period ending on the final day of the update
period;
(B) components of rate base as defined by §25.231(c)(2) of this title shall be included through
the end of the update period;
(C) the electric utility’s cost of capital shall be updated to reflect any transactions affecting
those items that occur between the end of the test year and the end of the update period;
and
(D) the utility’s sales revenues, customer count, and billing determinants shall reflect the 12-
month period ending on the final day of the update period.
(4) Use of estimates; supplementation of information.
(A) An electric utility that includes estimated information for the update period in the initial
filing of a rate proceeding shall supplement that filing with actual information not later
than the 45th day after the date the initial filing was made. The update must provide actual
information for all information originally estimated. The utility shall update every
component of its cost of service that changed, including flow-through effects and attendant
impacts of changes. The utility need not, however, update or refile every piece of
information in the originally filed case. The utility shall file the entire update on a single
business day.
(B) The commission shall extend the deadline for concluding the rate proceeding for a period
of time equal to the period between the date the initial filing of the proceeding was made
and the date of the supplemental filing made under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph,
except that the extension period may not exceed 45 days.
(5) Known and measurable changes. In establishing the base rates of an electric utility, an electric
utility that makes an election under paragraph (2) of this subsection is not precluded from proposing
known and measurable adjustments to the utility’s historical rate information as permitted by PURA
and the commission’s rules.

(6) Post-test year adjustment for newly constructed or acquired natural-gas-fired power plant.
In addition to the test year update authorized by paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, and without
limiting the availability of known and measurable adjustments otherwise permitted by PURA and
commission rules, the commission shall allow an electric utility to make a known and measurable
adjustment for a newly constructed or acquired natural-gas-fired generation facility.
(A) The commission is required to allow a known and measurable adjustment under this
paragraph only if the natural-gas-fired generation facility is in service before the effective
date of new rates.
(B) A known and measurable adjustment under this paragraph shall include the utility’s
prudent capital investment in the facility, a reasonable return on such capital investment,
depreciation expense, reasonable and necessary operating expenses, and all attendant
impacts associated with the newly constructed or acquired natural-gas-fired generation
facility, including any offsetting revenue, as determined by the commission.
(C) Notwithstanding the requirements of §25.231(c)(2)(F)(i)(II) of this title, the commission
shall allow an adjustment under this paragraph regardless of whether the investment is less
than 10% of the utility’s rate base before the date of the adjustment.
(c) Requirement to initiate rate proceeding.
(1) Timing. An electric utility is required to make filings with regulatory authorities as required by
PURA, Chapter 33, Subchapter B, and shall file a rate-filing package under PURA, Chapter 36,
Subchapter D, to initiate a comprehensive base rate proceeding before all of the utility’s regulatory
authorities in the following circumstances:
(A) on or before the fourth anniversary of the date of the final order in the utility’s most recent
comprehensive base rate proceeding; or
(B) if the commission determines, before the deadline described in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph, that the utility has earned materially more than the utility’s authorized rate of
return on investment, on a weather-normalized basis, in the utility’s two most recent
consecutive commission earnings monitoring reports.
(C) If a rate-filing package is required to be submitted under this subsection, the utility’s rate
filing shall reflect a test year, which at the election of the utility may be updated pursuant
to subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section, and may be otherwise adjusted for known and
measurable changes as permitted by PURA and commission rules.
(2) Extension of rate-case-filing deadline. A utility is required to make a rate filing by the deadline
set forth in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection unless the commission grants an extension of the
deadline. The commission may extend the deadline set forth in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection
and set a new deadline if the commission determines that a comprehensive base rate case would not
result in materially different rates. The utility shall have the burden to prove that a delay in the ratecase-filing deadline is warranted and shall submit all requisite information to meet such burden.
(A) On or before the third anniversary of the date of the final order in the utility’s most recent
comprehensive base rate proceeding, the utility shall submit a filing to the commission
indicating whether the utility seeks an extension to the deadline described in paragraph
(1)(A) of this subsection. If the utility seeks an extension, at the time of such filing it shall
provide all relevant information to meet its burden in showing that an extension is justified.
The commission shall give interested parties a reasonable opportunity to present materials
and argument before making a determination under this paragraph; the Administrative Law
Judge(s) assigned to the docket concerning the extension shall set procedural guidelines,
including discovery limits and deadlines allowing the commission sufficient time to
provide notice pursuant to paragraph (3)(A)(i) of this subsection.
(B) Standard of review. In determining whether to extend the time period for the filing of a
base rate proceeding, the commission may consider matters such as the following:
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.

Effective 7/31/16
(i) the results of recent earnings monitoring reports for the utility, including such
adjustments to those reports as may be found appropriate by the commission;
(ii) recent and expected levels of expenses, sales revenues, and capital investment for
the utility;
(iii) recent and projected financial results for the utility;
(iv) continued appropriateness of the utility’s allocation of costs and rate design;
(v) capital market conditions;
(vi) whether there has been a material change in circumstances since the utility’s base
rates were last established by the commission; and
(vii) any other factors the commission deems relevant to its determination.
(3) Notice.
(A) Notice to the utility. The utility must make the filings described in paragraph (1) of this
subsection not later than the 120th day after the date the commission provides written
notice to the utility:
(i) that a filing under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection will be required; or
(ii) that the condition of material over-earning described by paragraph (1)(B) of this
subsection exists. The 120-day period provided by this subsection may be
extended by the commission for good cause.
(B) Notice to parties. If the utility seeks an extension to the filing deadline pursuant to
paragraph (2) of this subsection, the utility shall provide, at the time the utility submits its
filing to the commission requesting an extension, notice to all persons who were parties to
the utility’s most recent base rate proceeding.
(d) Relation back of rates.
(1) In a rate proceeding under PURA, Chapter 36, Subchapter D, or if requested by an electric utility in
the utility’s statement of intent initiating a rate proceeding under PURA, Chapter 36, Subchapter C,
notwithstanding PURA §36.109(a), the final rate set in the proceeding, whether a rate increase or
rate decrease, shall be made effective for consumption on and after the 155th day after the date the
rate-filing package is filed. Unless the commission approves temporary rates under PURA
§36.109(a), the utility’s new rates will not be implemented until the commission issues its final order
approving new rates.
(2) The commission shall:
(A) require the electric utility to refund to customers money collected in excess of the rate
finally ordered on or after the 155th day after the date the rate-filing package is filed; or
(B) authorize the electric utility to collect a surcharge from customers to recover the amount
by which the money collected on or after the 155th day after the utility files its rate-filing
package is less than the money that would have been collected under the rate finally
ordered.
(3) The commission may require refunds or surcharges of amounts determined under paragraph (2) of
this subsection over a period not to exceed 18 months, along with appropriate carrying costs. The
commission shall make any adjustments necessary to prevent over-recovery of amounts reflected in
riders in effect for the electric utility during the pendency of the rate proceeding. Customers who
receive service at transmission voltage levels, as well as any groups of seasonal agricultural
customers as identified by the electric utility, shall be subject to refund or surcharge rates calculated
based upon their individual historical usage and demand recorded during each month in the period
in which the refund or surcharge obligation arose, adjusted for line losses if necessary. All other
customers shall be subject to refund or surcharge rates calculated based upon the historical usage
and demand of all customers served under the same tariffed rate schedule recorded during each
month in the period in which the refund or surcharge obligation arose, adjusted for line losses if
necessary.

(a) Application. This section applies to investor-owned electric utilities and non-investor-owned transmission
service providers operating inside the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).
(b) Filing requirements for investor-owned electric utilities.
(1) Each investor-owned electric utility in the ERCOT region must file for a comprehensive rate review
within 48 months of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding or other
proceeding in which the commission approved a settlement agreement reflecting a rate modification
that allowed the electric utility to avoid the filing of such a rate case. For an investor-owned
transmission and distribution utility, the filing must include information necessary for the review of
both transmission and distribution rates.
(2) On a year-to-year basis, the commission shall issue an order extending the filing requirements under
paragraph (1) of this subsection by one year if the following conditions are met:
(A) for an investor-owned electric utility providing transmission-only service, the utility’s most
recent earnings monitoring report, as of 180 days before its scheduled filing date
established by this section, filed in compliance with commission rules and instructions or
as adjusted by the commission to conform with the rules and instructions, shows that it is
earning, on a weather-normalized basis using weather data for the most recent ten calendar
years, less than 50 basis points above the average of the most recent commission-approved
rate of return on equity for each investor-owned transmission-only utility operating in
ERCOT; or
(B) for an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, the utility’s most recent
earnings monitoring report, as of 180 days before its scheduled filing date established by
this section, filed in compliance with commission rules and instructions or as adjusted by
the commission to conform with the rules and instructions, shows that it is earning, on a
weather-normalized basis using weather data for the most recent ten calendar years, less
than 50 basis points above the average of the most recent commission-approved rate of
return on equity for each investor-owned transmission and distribution utility operating in
ERCOT with at least 175,000 metered customers.
(3) The commission may extend the scheduled filing deadline under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
subsection for good cause shown or because of resource constraints of the commission.
(4) An investor-owned electric utility qualifying for an extension under paragraph (2) of this subsection
shall submit notice in the same project as the filing of its most recent earnings monitoring report at
least 180 days before the fourth anniversary of the order in its most recent comprehensive rate
proceeding or other proceeding in which the commission approved a settlement agreement reflecting
a rate modification that allowed the electric utility to avoid the filing of such a rate case.
(5) Nothing in this section limits the commission’s authority to initiate a rate proceeding at any time
under this title on the basis of other criteria that the commission determines are in the public interest,
including but not limited to the information provided in an investor-owned electric utility’s earnings
monitoring report.
(c) Transition issues for investor-owned electric utilities.
(1) If an investor-owned electric utility has a comprehensive rate proceeding pending on the effective
date of this rule, the electric utility is required to file, after the commission’s final order in that
pending proceeding, a comprehensive rate proceeding in accordance with subsection (b) of this
section. If the pending proceeding is withdrawn, dismissed, or otherwise resolved without a final
order, the investor-owned electric utility shall be subject to the transition timelines in paragraph (2)
of this subsection unless the commission orders otherwise.

adjusted for accumulated depreciation and any changes in accumulated deferred federal income
taxes, including changes to excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes, associated with all
power generation facilities included in the electric utility’s GCRR.
(6) Weather-normalized -- Adjusted for normal weather using weather data for the most recent tenyear period prior to the year from which the GCRR billing determinants are derived.
(c) GCRR Requirements. The GCRR rate for each rate class, and any other terms or conditions related to those
rates, will be specified in a rider to the utility’s tariff.
(1) An electric utility must not have more than one GCRR.
(2) An electric utility with an existing GCRR may apply to amend the GCRR to include the electric
utility’s actual capital investment in a power generation facility and additional power generation
facilities.
(3) Any GCRR established under this section will take effect on the date the power generation facility
begins providing service to the electric utility’s customers. Any amendment to an existing GCRR
for an additional power generation facility will take effect on the date that the additional power
generation facility begins providing service to the electric utility’s customers.
(4) As part of the next base-rate proceeding for the electric utility, the electric utility must request to
move all investment being recovered in a GCRR into base rates and the GCRR will be set to zero.
(d) Calculation of GCRR Rates. The GCRR rate for each rate class must be calculated according to the
provisions of this subsection and subsections (e) and (f) of this section.
(1) The GCRR rates will not take into account changes in the number of the electric utility’s customers
and the effects that energy consumption and energy demand have on the amount of revenue

Effective 07/28/2020
(P 50031)
(3) The GCRR rate for each rate class will be calculated using the following formula:
GCRRCLASS = RRCLASS / BDC-CLASS
(4) The values of the terms used in this subsection will be calculated as follows:
(A) RRCLASS = RRTOT * ALLOCC-CLASS
(B) RRTOT = TRAF * ((PGFIC * RORRC) + PGFDEPR + PGFFIT + PGFOT)
(C) ALLOCC-CLASS =
ALLOCRC-CLASS * (BDC-CLASS / BDRC-CLASS) / Σ (ALLOCRC-CLASS * (BDC-CLASS / BDRCCLASS))
(5) The terms used in this subsection represent or are defined as follows:
(A) Descriptions of calculated values.
(i) GCRRCLASS -- GCRR rate for a rate class.
(ii) RRCLASS -- GCRR class revenue requirement.
(iii) RRTOT -- Total GCRR revenue requirement.

(B) GCRR billing determinants and power generation facility values.
(i) BDC-CLASS -- GCRR billing determinants that are weather-normalized.
(ii) PGFIC -- Power generation facility net invested capital.
(iii) PGFDEPR -- Power generation facility depreciation expense.
(iv) PGFFIT -- Federal income tax expense associated with the return on the power
generation facility net invested capital, reduced by any tax credits related to the
power generation facility that are not returned to customers as a credit or other
offset to eligible fuel expense.
(v) PGFOT -- Other tax expense associated with the power generation facility.
(C) Baseline values. The following values are based on those values used to establish rates in
the electric utility’s most recent base-rate proceeding, or if an input to the GCRR
calculation from the electric utility’s last base-rate proceeding is not separately identified
in that proceeding, it will be derived from information from that proceeding:
(i) TRAF -- Texas retail jurisdiction production allocation factor value used to
establish rates in the electric utility’s last base-rate proceeding determined under
the provisions of subsection (e) of this section.
(ii) BDRC-CLASS -- Rate class billing determinants used to establish generation base
rates in the last base-rate proceeding. Energy-based billing determinants will be
used for those rate classes that do not include any rate demand charges, and
demand-based billing determinants will be used for those rate classes that include
rate demand charges.
(iii) RORRC -- After-tax rate of return approved by the commission in the electric
utility’s last base-rate proceeding.
(iv) ALLOCRC-CLASS -- Rate class allocation factor value determined under the
provisions of subsection (e) of this section.
(e) Jurisdictional and class allocation factors. For calculating GCRR rates, the baseline jurisdictional and

PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 07/28/2020
(P 50031)
include another discrete power generation facility even if it has another application to amend its GCRR
pending before the commission. The proceeding for a GCRR application must conform to the requirements
of this subsection.
(1) Scope of proceeding. The issues of whether generation invested capital included in an application
for a GCRR complies with PURA and is prudent, reasonable, and necessary will not be addressed
in a GCRR proceeding.
(2) Notice. The applicant must notify all parties in the applicant’s last base-rate proceeding that an
application was filed. The notice must be provided by first-class mail and mailed the same day the
application is filed. The notice must specify the docket number assigned to the application and a
copy of the application must be included with the notice.
(3) Parties and intervention. Requests to intervene must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after
the date the application is filed. Objections to a request to intervene must be filed no later than five
working days after the request is filed. All requests to intervene must be ruled upon no later than
21 calendar days after the application is filed.
(4) GCRR forms. If the commission adopts a form for GCRR applications, an electric utility must file
its application using that form.
(5) Sufficiency of application. A motion to find the application materially deficient must be filed no
later than 10 calendar days after the application is filed. A motion to find an amended application
deficient, when the amendment is in response to an order issued under this paragraph, must be filed
no later than five working days after the amended application is filed. The motion must specify the
nature of any alleged deficiency and, if the commission has adopted a form for a GCRR application,
the particular requirements of the form for which the application is alleged to be out of compliance.
The applicant’s response to such motion must be filed no later than five working days after the
motion is filed. Within five working days of the applicant’s response, the presiding officer must
issue an order finding the application sufficient or deficient, and if deficient must specify the
deficiencies and the time within which the applicant must amend its application to cure the
deficiencies. If the presiding officer has not issued a written order within 35 calendar days of the
filing of the application, or 25 calendar days of the filing of an amended application, concluding
that material deficiencies exist in the application, the application is sufficient.
(6) Action on application. If the requirements of §22.35 of this title are met, the presiding officer must
issue a notice of approval within 60 calendar days of the date an application is found to be sufficient
by order or rule. The presiding officer may extend this time if a party demonstrates that additional
time is needed to review the application or the presiding officer needs additional time to prepare the
notice of approval. Further, if the presiding officer determines that the application should be
considered by the commission, the presiding officer must issue a proposed order for consideration
by the commission at the next available open meeting.
(h) Update of generation invested capital. Within 60 calendar days after a power generation facility included
in a GCRR begins providing service to the electric utility’s customers, the electric utility may file an
application to update the GCRR to reflect the electric utility’s actual capital investment in the power
generation facility. An application to update the GCRR under this subsection is subject to the requirements
in subsection (g) of this section. Any update to the GCRR made under this subsection must include carrying
costs on the amount of investment in excess of the investment initially approved for recovery under
subsection (g) of this section. Carrying costs will accrue monthly from the date the power generation facility
began providing service to the electric utility’s customers through the date the adjustment is approved and
must be calculated using the rate of return approved by the commission in the electric utility’s most recent
base-rate proceeding.

(i) Reconciliation.
(1) Amounts recovered through a GCRR approved under this section are subject to reconciliation in the
first base-rate proceeding for the electric utility that is filed after the effective date of the GCRR.
The reconciliation will true up the total amount actually recovered through the GCRR approved
under this section with the total revenue requirement that the approved GCRR was designed to
recover. As part of the reconciliation, the commission will determine if the amounts recovered
through the GCRR are reasonable and necessary.
(2) Any amounts recovered through the GCRR that are found to have been unreasonable, unnecessary,
or imprudent, plus the corresponding return and taxes, must be refunded with carrying costs.
Carrying costs will be determined as follows:
(A) For the time period beginning with the date on which over-recovery is determined to have
begun to the effective date of the electric utility’s base rates set in the base-rate proceeding
in which the GCRR is reconciled, carrying costs will accrue monthly and will be calculated
using an effective monthly interest rate based on the same rate of return that was applied
to the investments included in the GCRR.
(B) For the time period beginning with the effective date of the electric utility’s rates set in the
base-rate proceeding in which the GCRR is reconciled, carrying costs will accrue monthly
and will be calculated using an effective monthly interest rate based on the electric utility’s
rate of return authorized in that base-rate proceeding.
(j) Threshold to initiate base-rate proceeding. If a GCRR approved under this section includes cumulative
incremental recovery for a power generation facility or power generation facilities where the amount of
generation invested capital is greater than $200 million on a Texas jurisdictional basis, the electric utility
must initiate a base-rate proceeding at the commission not later than 18 months after the date the GCRR takes
effect.

(12) Transportation equipment — A rail spur at a lignite-fired electric generating facility installed to
receive deliveries of western coal. Transportation equipment does not include rail cars and unloading
facilities.
(d) Requirements.
(1) Qualifying retrofit costs. To be eligible for recovery as invested capital pursuant to PURA §39.263,
a retrofit cost must be:
(A) reasonable and prudent;
(B) incurred in carrying out the most cost-effective alternative for improving air quality as approved
pursuant to this section;
(C) incurred to reduce or offset emissions by an amount and at a location that is consistent with the
air quality goals and policies of the conservation commission;
(D) incurred to offset or reduce the emission of airborne contaminants from an electric generating
facility, where:
(i) the emission reduction or offset is determined by the conservation commission to be an
essential component in achieving compliance with a national ambient air quality
standard. For purposes of this section, any emission reduction or offset achieved by an
electric utility or affiliated power generation company to comply with conservation
commission regulations at 30 TAC Chapter 117 is deemed to have been determined by
the conservation commission to be an essential component in achieving compliance with
a national ambient air quality standard; or
(ii) the reduction or offset is necessary for an unpermitted electric generating facility to
obtain a permit in the manner provided by PURA §39.264; and
(E) associated with the engineering, procurement, or installation of pollution control equipment or
transportation equipment, or the purchase of emissions allowances.
(2) Qualifying retirement costs. Retirement costs may be included in the electric generating facility’s
stranded cost determination if retirement of the facility is the most cost-effective alternative, taking
into account the cost of replacement generating capacity. Recoverable retirement costs are the net
book value of the facility, including retirement costs, less salvage value.
(3) When costs incurred. For purposes of this section, the electric utility or affiliated power generation
company has incurred costs if it has expended funds or has committed to expend funds under the terms
of a written agreement.
(4) Operating and maintenance costs. This section does not authorize the recovery of operating and
maintenance costs or the capital cost of a new electric generating facility.
(5) Apportionment of reductions. As provided in this paragraph, the commission may apportion the
capital invested to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, or both, among one or more
entities owning facilities located in the same region. The capital investments for which recovery is
sought must have been incurred pursuant to a written agreement between the entities executed prior to 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 10/01/00
the date any such costs were incurred. The commission may not apportion capital costs under this
provision unless the criteria of paragraph (1) of this subsection are met for each electric generating
facility seeking capital cost recovery. Capital costs shall be apportioned by prorating the total capital
invested between entities on the basis of reductions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, or both, realized
at each participating entity’s facilities in the region.
(e) Request for approval of cost-effectiveness determination.
(1) Application. On or before January 10, 2003, an electric utility or affiliated power generation company
that seeks recovery of capital costs pursuant to this section shall file an application for a determination
that its plan for meeting the requirements of PURA §39.264 and the regulatory programs designed to
achieve compliance with national ambient air quality standards are cost-effective under this section.
No more than one application may be filed for generating facilities owned by the same electric utility
or affiliated power generation company in the same region. The application shall include the
information specified in subparagraphs (A) – (H) of this paragraph.
(A) Description. A general description of the generating facility, including but not limited to:
(i) net generating capacity in megawatts;
(ii) type of fuel used for electric generation;
(iii) the county and region in which each facility addressed in the application is located;
(iv) average capacity factor for the three most current calendar years as reported to the
commission;
(v) generation in megawatt-hours for the three most current calendar years, as reported on
Form EIA-767 or if not available on Form EIA-767, then as reported to the Public Utility
Commission of Texas;
(vi) the expected remaining life of the facility; and
(vii) any other information required to perform the analysis prescribed by this section.
(B) Total emissions. The total annual emissions (in tons) of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide:
(i) for the year 1997;
(ii) for the most recent calendar year for which data is available;
(iii) that is expected for the first calendar year after the implementation of the air quality
improvement strategies for which cost recovery will be requested; and
(iv) for the calendar years 2003 through 2005.
(C) Allocated emissions allowances. The number of emission allowances allocated to the electric
generating facility by the conservation commission.
(D) Capital cost estimate. The total amount of qualifying capital costs for each option evaluated by
the electric utility or affiliated power generation company.
(E) Alternatives. A decision analysis for all electric generating facilities owned by a utility or
affiliated power generation company in the same region comparing the cost-effectiveness of the
retirement option with retrofit options and all other possible options considered by the electric
utility or affiliated power company. Other options shall include:
(i) offsetting emissions at the electric generating facility by installing control technology at
another facility, consistent with the rules of the conservation commission; and
(ii) switching fuel used for electricity generation at the electric generating facility.
(F) Comparative cost analysis. The net present value of the capital, operating, and maintenance
costs of each option considered pursuant to subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. The period of
the analysis shall begin on May 1, 2003, and extend for a period of 15 years. The discount rate
used in the analysis and the cost of capital associated with each option shall be calculated
differently. Both shall start with the capital structure and cost of capital as they are reported for
the end of 1999 in the utility’s annual report made pursuant to PURA §39.257. The discount
rate shall be the after-tax weighted cost of capital, while the cost of capital associated with each 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 10/01/00
option shall be taken directly from the annual report, except for the cost of debt. The cost of
debt for this purpose shall be the average cost of debt for the months of October, November, and
December 1999 as reported by Moody’s Investors Service for utilities with the same Moody’s
bond rating as the utility making the filing adjusted to reflect any tax-exemption benefits for
which a particular option might qualify. All assumptions used in the analysis shall be provided.
If the lowest-cost alternative is not selected as the most cost-effective, an explanation of why it
was not selected shall be provided. Where an electric generating facility is required to remain
active to ensure reliability, retrofit shall be deemed to be the most cost-effective alternative for
that facility. The commission shall give great weight to the recommendation of the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Independent System Operator (ISO) in determining
whether a facility is needed for reliability purposes.
(G) Retrofit. The retrofit alternative analysis shall include calculation of retrofit cost and an estimate
of the total cost per ton of pollutant reduced for each option considered. The retrofit alternative
analysis shall also include the time-discounted, probability–adjusted cost of environmental
retrofits that are reasonably foreseeable to require air quality improvement compliance no later
than 2010. If the expected remaining life of the generating facility is less than 15 years, the
retrofit analysis shall include the net present value of all relevant costs of retirement for those
years remaining after the retirement date.
(H) Retirement. The retirement analysis shall include the net present value of all relevant costs of
retirement for each electric generating facility, including:
(i) the cost of replacement generating capacity in dollars as defined in subsection (c)(2) of
this section. The amount of replacement generating capacity shall be the generating
capacity of the unit retired adjusted, when appropriate and depending upon the size of
the unit, to reflect energy savings or additions attributable to energy efficiency,
transmission upgrades, distributed generation, and other similar measures; and
(ii) the net book value of the facility, including retirement costs and offsetting salvage value,
which includes but is not limited to the market value of the land after the facility is
retired, and the value of water rights, pollution credits or benefits associated with the
facility, and other infrastructure.
(2) Notice. Notice of an application for approval of a cost-effectiveness determination shall be provided
through newspaper publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation throughout the service area of each electric generating facility addressed in the application.
Such newspaper notice shall state in plain language:
(A) the purpose of the application;
(B) the electric generating facilities addressed in the application;
(C) the air quality improvement strategy proposed for each electric generating facility addressed in
the application; and
(D) the date the application will be deemed approved if no objection is filed with the commission.
(3) Approval of an application for determination of cost-effectiveness. An application shall be
deemed approved without further commission action if no objection to the application is filed with the
commission within 60 days after the application was filed and adequate notice has been completed.
(4) Decision. If an application for approval of an emissions reduction plan is not approved under
paragraph (3) of this subsection, the commission shall render a decision approving or denying the
application within 180 days from the date of filing of a complete application unless good cause is
shown for extending the 180-day period.
(f) Reconciliation of environmental cleanup costs during the true-up proceedings. The commission’s final
determination of recoverable environmental cleanup costs under PURA §39.263 shall be made during the
true-up proceedings under PURA §39.262, subject to the provisions of this paragraph:
(1) Burden of proof for recovery of costs.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 10/01/00
(A) Burden of proof. In determining the amount of environmental cleanup costs that the electric
utility may recover as invested capital under PURA §39.263, the electric utility or affiliated
power generation company has the burden of showing that its qualifying costs during the period
were prudent, reasonable, and necessary and were incurred to implement the most cost-effective
alternative.
(B) Benchmarks. For those electric generating facilities where their owners can show that
retrofitting the facilities is more cost effective than retiring them, the commission presumes that
costs for retrofitting a natural gas-fired electric generating facility that are no more than $7.00
per kilowatt for nitrogen oxide combustion control technology and $25 per kilowatt for
technology that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% or more are reasonable and prudent.
Likewise, the commission presumes that costs for retrofitting a coal-fired electric generating
facility that are no more than $10 per kilowatt for nitrogen oxide combustion control technology
and $50 per kilowatt for technology that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% or more are
reasonable and prudent. For actual costs that exceed these per-kilowatt benchmarks, the utility
must establish that those costs were reasonably incurred. Costs that the utility estimates and the
commission affirms as the estimated costs of each plant’s environmental retrofit, as determined
in a proceeding under subsection (e) of this section, shall be aggregated as the maximum
reasonable and prudent investment for the fleet retrofit, and the costs in excess of the fleet total
are not recoverable through stranded costs.
(2) Scope. Any issue related to determining the prudence and reasonableness of the environmental cleanup costs which the electric utility or affiliated power generation company is seeking recovery as
invested capital shall be within the scope of the proceeding. The prudence and reasonableness of the
alternative selected for each electric generating facility is not within the scope of this proceeding.

approved in a generic proceeding pursuant to this section for any utility whose customers are not
offered competition on January 1, 2002.
(4) As part of the true-up proceeding, the commission shall make a determination with respect to
whether the TDU, the APGC, and the AREP have complied with PURA §39.252(d). If the
commission finds that the TDU, the APGC, or the AREP have failed, individually or in combination,
to fully comply with their obligations under PURA §39.252(d), the commission may reduce the net
book value of the APGC’s generation assets or take other measures it deems appropriate in the trueup proceeding filed under this section. In making a determination as to compliance with PURA
§39.252(d), the commission shall not substitute its judgment for a market valuation of generation
assets determined under PURA §39.262(h) or (i).
(5) The State Office of Administrative Hearings shall employ expedited procedures during discovery
in the true-up proceedings.

foregoing, however, the 150-day deadline may be extended by the commission for good cause.
(f) Quantification of market value of generation assets.
(1) Market value of generation assets shall be quantified using one or more of the following methods:
(A) Sale of assets method. If an electric utility or its APGC sells some or all of its generation
assets after December 31, 1999, in a bona fide third-party transaction under a competitive
offering, the total net value realized from the sale shall establish the market value of the
generation assets sold. Within 30 days of closing, the utility or its APGC shall provide to
the commission a detailed explanation, which may be filed confidentially, of the
transaction and a description of the generating unit, property boundaries, fuel and parts,
emission allowances, and other general categories of items associated with the sale,
including any ancillary items related to the assets.
(B) Stock valuation method. The following method of market valuation without using a
control premium may be used to value generation assets.
(i) If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its APGC has
transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the
electric utility or the APGC, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to
those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, not
less than 51% of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to
public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has
been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of
the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission
out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the true-up filing required by
this section establishes the market value of the common stock equity in each
transferee corporation.
(ii) The average book value of each transferee corporation’s debt and preferred stock
securities during the 30-day period chosen by the commission to determine the
market value of common stock shall be added to the market value of its stock.
(iii) The market value of each transferee corporation’s assets that is determined as the
sum of clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall be reduced by the
corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by the transferee corporation
from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or APGC.
(iv) The market value of the assets determined from the procedures required by
clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph establishes the market value of the 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/20/06
generation assets transferred by the affiliated electric utility or APGC to each
separate corporation
(C) Partial stock valuation method. The following method of market valuation using a
control premium may be used to value generation assets.
(i) If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its APGC has
transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the
electric utility or the APGC, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to
those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, at
least 19%, but less than 51%, of the common stock of each corporation is spun
off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the
common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average
daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen
by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing
establishes the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee
corporation.
(ii) The commission may accept the market valuation to conclusively establish the
value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation or convene a
valuation panel of three independent financial experts to determine whether the
per-share value of the common stock sold is fairly representative of the per-share
value of the total common stock equity or whether a control premium exists for
the retained interest.
(iii) Should the commission elect to convene a valuation panel, the panel must consist
of financial experts chosen from proposals submitted in response to commission
requests from the top ten nationally recognized investment banks with
demonstrated experience in the United States electric industry, as indicated by the
dollar amount of public offerings of long-term debt and equity of United States
investor-owned electric companies over the immediately preceding three years as
ranked by the publication “Securities Data” or “Institutional Investor.”
(iv) If the panel determines that a control premium exists for the retained interest, the
panel shall determine the amount of the control premium, and the commission
shall adopt the determination, but may not use the control premium to increase
the value of the assets by more than 10%.
(v) The costs and expenses of the panel, as approved by the commission, shall be paid
by each transferee corporation.
(vi) The determination of the commission, based on the finding of the panel and other
admitted evidence, conclusively establishes the value of the common stock of
each transferee corporation.
(vii) The average book value of each transferee corporation’s debt and preferred stock
securities during the 30-day period chosen by the commission to determine the
market value of common stock shall be added to the market value of its stock.
(viii) The market value of each transferee corporation’s assets shall be reduced by the
corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by the transferee corporation
from any entity other than the electric utility or its APGC.
(ix) The market value of the assets resulting from the procedures required by clauses
(i) - (viii) of this subparagraph establishes the market value of the generation
assets transferred by the electric utility or APGC to each transferee corporation.
(D) Exchange of assets method. If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or
its APGC transfers some or all of its generation assets, including any fuel and fuel
transportation contracts related to those assets, in a bona fide third-party exchange
transaction, the stranded costs related to the transferred assets shall be the difference 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/20/06
between the net book value and the market value of the transferred assets at the time of the
exchange, taking into account any other consideration received or given.
(i) The market value of the transferred assets may be determined through an appraisal
by a nationally recognized independent appraisal firm, if the market value is
subject to a market valuation by means of an offer of sale in accordance with this
subparagraph.
(ii) To obtain a market valuation by means of an offer of sale, the owner of the asset
shall offer it for sale to other parties under procedures that provide broad public
notice of the offer and a reasonable opportunity for other parties to bid on the
asset. The owner of the asset shall provide to the commission copies of all
documentation explaining and attesting to the utility’s sale proposal.
(iii) The owner of the asset may establish a reserve price for any offer based on the
sum of the appraised value of the asset and the tax impact of selling the asset, as
determined by the commission.
(iv) Within 30 days of closing, the utility or its APGC shall provide to the commission
a detailed explanation, which may be filed confidentially, of the transaction and a
description of the generating unit, property boundaries, fuel and parts, emission
allowances, and other general categories of items associated with the transfer,
including any ancillary items related to the assets.
(2) ECOM Method. Unless an electric utility or its APGC combines all its remaining generation assets
into one or more transferee corporations pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) or (C) of this subsection, the
electric utility shall quantify its stranded costs for nuclear assets using the ECOM method.
(A) The ECOM method is the estimation model prepared for and described by the
commission’s April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric
Restructuring entitled “Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report: 1998 Update.”
The methodology used in the model must be the same as that used in the 1998 report to
determine the “base case.”
(B) As part of the filing specified in subsection (d) of this section, the electric utility shall rerun
the ECOM model using updated company specific inputs required by the model, updating
the market price of electricity, and using updated natural gas price forecasts and the
capacity cost based on the long-run marginal cost of the most economic new generation
technology then available, as approved by the commission pursuant to subsection (e)(3) of
this section. Natural gas price projections used in the model shall be forward prices of
Houston Ship Channel natural gas.
(C) Growth rates in generating plant operations and maintenance costs and allocated
administrative and general costs shall be benchmarked by comparing those costs to the best
available information on cost trends for comparable generating plants.
(D) Capital additions shall be benchmarked using the 1.5% limitation set forth in PURA
§39.259(b).
(g) Quantification of net book value of generation assets.
(1) For purposes of this section, the net book value of generation assets shall be established as of
December 31, 2001, or the date a market value is established through a market valuation method
under subsection (f) of this section, whichever is earlier.
(2) Net book value of generation assets consists of:
(A) The generation-related electric plant in service, less accumulated depreciation (exclusive
of depreciation related to mitigation), plus generation-related construction work in
progress, plant held for future use, and nuclear, coal, and lignite fuel inventories, reduced
by:
(i) net mitigation;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/20/06
(ii) the net book value of nuclear generation assets if quantification of ECOM related
to those nuclear generation assets is determined pursuant to PURA §39.262(i);
and
(iii) any generation-related invested capital recoverable through a CTC, exclusive of
related carrying costs, projected to be collected through the date of the final order
in the true-up proceeding.
(B) Above-market purchased power costs arising from contracts in effect before January 1,
1999, including any amendments and revisions to such contracts resulting from litigation
initiated before January 1, 1999.
(i) The purchased power market value of the demand and energy included in the
purchased power contracts shall be determined by using the weighted average
costs of the highest three offers from a bona fide third-party transaction or
transactions on the open market.
(ii) The bona fide third-party transaction or transactions on the open market shall be
structured so that the above-market purchased power costs are determined
pursuant to subclause (I) or (II) of this clause.
(I) A transaction may be structured so the electric utility pays a third party
to assume the utility’s obligations under the purchased power contract.
The weighted average of the three highest offers received in the
transaction establishes the above-market purchased power costs.
(II) A transaction may be structured so a third party pays the utility to take
power under the purchased power contract. The difference between the
net present value of obligations under the existing contracts at the
utility’s cost of capital and the weighted average of the three highest
offers received in the transaction establishes the above-market purchased
power costs.
(C) Deferred debits, to the extent they have not been securitized, related to a utility’s
discontinuance of the application of SFAS No. 71 (“Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation”) for generation-related assets if required by PURA Chapter 39.
(D) Capital costs incurred before May 1, 2003 to improve air quality to the extent they have
been approved by the commission pursuant to §25.261 of this title (relating to Stranded
Cost Recovery of Environmental Cleanup Costs).
(E) Any adjustments resulting from the commission’s review of the TDU’s, APGC’s, and
AREP’s efforts pursuant to subsection (e)(4) of this section.
(h) True-up of final fuel balance.
(1) An APGC shall reconcile the former electric utility’s final fuel balance determined under PURA
§39.202(c).
(2) The final fuel balance shall be reduced by any revenues collected by the AREP under any
commission-approved fuel surcharge, from the date of introduction of competition to the utility’s
customers through the date of the true-up filing under this section, so long as the fuel surcharge is
associated with fuel costs incurred during the time period covered by the final reconcilable fuel
balance.
(3) If an electric utility or its TDU or APGC is assessed by another utility in Texas a fuel surcharge
after 2001 for under-recoveries occurring through the end of 2001, the surcharged utility shall add
the amount of surcharges and any associated carrying costs paid after 2001 to its final fuel balance.
(4) The final fuel balance, as adjusted by paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, shall include carrying
costs on the positive or negative fuel balance equal to:
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/20/06
(A) the weighted-average cost of capital approved in the company’s unbundled cost of service
(UCOS) proceeding, if the period until the date of the final true-up order is greater than
one year; or
(B) the rate approved in §25.236 of this title (relating to Recovery of Fuel Costs) if the period
until the date of the final true-up order is one year or less.
(i) True-up of capacity auction proceeds.
(1) For purposes of the true-up required by PURA §39.262(d)(2), and as provided for under
§25.381(h)(1) of this title (relating to Capacity Auctions), the APGC shall compute the difference
between the price of power obtained through the capacity auctions conducted for the years 2002 and
2003 and the power cost projections for the same time period as used in the determination of ECOM
for that utility in the proceeding under PURA §39.201. The difference shall be calculated according
to the following formula: (ECOM market revenues – ECOM fuel costs) – ((capacity auction price x
total 2002 and 2003 busbar sales) – actual 2002 and 2003 fuel costs). For purposes of this paragraph:
(A) “ECOM market revenues” shall be the sum of rows 12 through 14 for the years 2002 and
2003 in the “Plant Economics” worksheet of the ECOM model underlying the commissionapproved ECOM estimate in the company’s UCOS proceeding;
(B) “ECOM fuel costs” shall be the sum of rows 33 through 35 for the years 2002 and 2003 in
the “Cost Partition” worksheet of the ECOM model underlying the commission-approved
ECOM estimate in the company’s UCOS proceeding;
(C) The “capacity auction price” shall be the APGC’s total capacity auction revenues derived
from the capacity auctions conducted for the years 2002 and 2003 divided by that APGC’s
total MWh sales of capacity auction products for the years 2002 and 2003.
(2) If, as a result of not having participated in capacity auctions pursuant to §25.381(h)(1) of this title,
an APGC is unable to determine a company-specific capacity auction price, the APGC may request
in its true-up application a method using prevailing capacity auction prices from other APGCs for
the calculation in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(j) True-up of PTB revenues. This subsection specifies how the PTB will be compared to prevailing market
prices pursuant to PURA §39.262(e). For purposes of this subsection, the term “small commercial customer”
does not include unmetered lighting accounts unless such an account has historically been treated as a
separate customer for billing purposes.
(1) An AREP is not required to perform the reconciliation described in PURA §39.262(e) for the
residential or small commercial customer class if the commission has determined that the AREP has
reached the applicable 40% threshold requirements prior to January 1, 2004, pursuant to filing
requirements listed in §25.41(l) of this title (relating to Price to Beat) applicable to that class.
(2) If an AREP has not reached the applicable 40% threshold requirements prior to January 1, 2004, for
either the residential or the small commercial class, or both, the net PTB for each such class must
be compared to the market price of electricity for that class in the TDU region for the period January
1, 2002 through January 1, 2004 as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection.
(3) The independent third party shall compute the difference between the residential net PTB and the
residential market price of electricity on the last day of each calendar-year quarter for the years 2002
and 2003. The price differential for each quarter shall be multiplied by the total kWh consumed by
residential PTB customers of the AREP for that quarter. The results shall be summed over the eight
quarters within the period from January 1, 2002 through January 1, 2004.
(4) The independent third party shall compute the difference between the small commercial net PTB
and the small commercial market price of electricity on the last day of each calendar-year quarter
for the years 2002 and 2003. The price differential for each quarter shall be multiplied by the total
kWh consumed by small commercial PTB customers of the AREP for that quarter. The results shall
be summed over the eight quarters within the period from January 1, 2002 through January 1, 2004.

Effective 7/20/06
(5) For each of the residential and small commercial classes, the AREP shall credit the TDU the lesser
of the amounts calculated in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph:
(A) $150 multiplied by (the difference between the number of residential or small commercial
customers, as applicable, in the TDU Region taking PTB service from the AREP on
January 1, 2004 and the number of residential or small commercial customers, as
applicable, outside the TDU region being served by the AREP on January 1, 2004, provided
that such customers are not receiving POLR service from the AREP); or
(B) the total differential between the net PTB and the market price of electricity calculated for
the applicable class under paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection.
(6) All REPs shall provide information to the independent third party as needed for the performance of
calculations set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. All data used in the calculations
performed by the independent third party will remain confidential but shall be subject to audit by
the commission.
(7) The functions of the independent third party shall be funded by the AREPs through one or more
assessments made by the commission.
(k) Regulatory assets. To the extent that any amount of regulatory assets included in a TC or CTC exceeds the
amount of regulatory assets approved in a rate order which became effective on or before September 1, 1999,
the commission shall conduct a review during the true-up proceeding to determine any such amounts that
were not appropriately calculated or that did not constitute reasonable and necessary costs. In addition, to
the extent that any amount of regulatory assets approved for securitization in a commission financing order
was not subsequently included in an issuance of transition bonds, that amount of regulatory assets shall be
included in the TDU/APGC true-up balance under subsection (l) of this section.
(l) TDU/APGC True-up balance.
(1) The formula to establish the true-up balance between the TDU and APGC is shown in the following
table. TDUs described in subsection (d)(3) of this section and their APGCs shall insert zero for all
inputs in this equation except the input entitled “Final fuel balance calculated pursuant to subsection
(h).”
Calculation of True-up Balance
Net book value calculated pursuant to subsection (g)
- Market value calculated pursuant to subsection (f)(1)
+/- Value calculated by ECOM model pursuant to subsection (f)(2)
+/- Final fuel balance calculated pursuant to subsection (h)
+/- Capacity auction true-up calculated pursuant to subsection (i)
+/- Regulatory asset amount calculated pursuant to subsection (k)
= TDU/APGC True-up Balance
(2) For TDUs described in subsection (d)(2) of this section, the TDU/APGC true-up balance shall be
compared to projected stranded costs as provided in subparagraphs (A) – (C) of this paragraph. For
TDUs described in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the TDU/APGC true-up balance shall be treated
as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph.
(A) If the TDU/APGC true-up balance is positive, and greater than projected stranded costs,
then the commission shall increase the CTC (or establish a CTC, if no CTC has previously
been approved for the utility), extend the time for the collection of the CTC, or both, to
enable the TDU to collect the TDU/APGC true-up balance. The utility may seek to
securitize any or all of the amounts determined under this subparagraph under PURA
Chapter 39, Subchapter G.

Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/20/06
(B) If the TDU/APGC true-up balance is positive, but less than projected stranded costs, then
the commission shall reduce nonbypassable delivery rates in the amount of the difference
by:
(i) reducing any CTC established under PURA §39.201;
(ii) reversing, in whole or in part, the depreciation expense that has been redirected
under PURA §39.256;
(iii) reducing the TDU’s rates; or
(iv) any combination of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph.
(C) If the TDU/APGC true-up balance is negative, then
(i) any CTC established under PURA §39.201 shall be eliminated;
(ii) net mitigation shall be reversed until exhausted or until a zero true-up balance is
achieved, and the amount of net mitigation reversed shall be returned to ratepayers
by the APGC through an excess mitigation credit; and
(iii) if net mitigation is exhausted and some amount of the negative true-up balance
remains, then for companies that have securitized regulatory assets, a negative
CTC shall be established based upon the lesser of the absolute value of the
remaining negative true-up balance or the securitization amount on which any
TCs are based. If the company has been issued a financing order by the
commission authorizing the securitization of regulatory assets but securitization
has not yet occurred, then the negative CTC will be implemented at the time the
securitization bonds are issued. If the company has not received a financing order
from the commission authorizing securitization of regulatory assets, then no
negative CTC shall be established for purposes of this subsection.
(D) If the TDU/APGC true-up balance is positive, then a CTC shall be imposed to enable the
APGC to recover any positive fuel balance. If the TDU/APGC true-up balance is negative,
then a fuel credit shall be implemented to return the over-recovered fuel balance to
ratepayers.
(3) The TDU shall be allowed to recover, or shall be liable for, carrying costs on the true-up balance.
This provision shall apply to all amounts the commission has authorized to be collected under this
section that have not been securitized. Carrying costs on the unrecovered true-up balance shall be
calculated from January 1, 2002, until the true-up balance is fully recovered. Based on the filing
described below that is made within 30 days of the effective date of this rule, carrying costs shall be
calculated using an interest rate determined as follows.
(A) The TDU shall file an application to adjust the carrying costs and amend its CTC tariff on
a prospective basis in conformance with this paragraph within 30 days of the effective date
of an amendment to this paragraph. The establishment of the interest rate used to calculate
carrying charges shall be based upon the following:
(i) The weighted average of the TDU’s unadjusted historical cost of debt (HC) and
an adjusted form of the TDU’s marginal cost of debt (MC), with the weightings
based on the utility’s most recently authorized capital structure. The HC
component shall be the cost of debt as determined in a final commission order,
provided that the order was entered within three years of the effective date of this
rule, for a rate proceeding in which the TDU’s cost of debt was explicitly
addressed or can be determined based upon the order’s authorized weightedaverage cost of capital (overall rate of return on invested capital), proportions of
debt and equity, and allowed return on equity. The MC component shall be based
upon the average yield for long-term bonds of public utilities with the TDU’s
current credit rating during the three-month period preceding the filing, as
published in Moody’s Credit Perspectives (or a similar publication if Moody’s
Credit Perspectives is not available). Additionally, the MC component shall be 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter J. COSTS, RATES, AND TARIFFS.
DIVISION 1. RETAIL RATES.
Effective 7/20/06
adjusted—i.e., grossed-up—for the effects of federal income taxes. The
following formula shall be used to determine the weighted-average carrying cost
described above:
CTC Carrying Charge Rate = MC * Equity Proportion of Most Recently
Authorized Capital Structure * 1/(1-Tax Rate) + HC * Debt Proportion of Most
Recently Authorized Capital Structure
(ii) If the commission, within three years prior to the effective date of this rule, did
not enter a final order in a rate proceeding that addresses the TDU’s cost of debt,
the HC component used in the interest rate determination described in the
preceding clause shall be based upon the cost of debt reported in the utility’s most
recent Earnings Monitoring Report filed pursuant to §25.73 of this title (relating
to Financial and Operating Reports), adjusted for known and measurable changes.
(B) In each rate case for the TDU, the calculation of carrying costs on the TDU’s unsecuritized
true-up balance shall be reviewed and adjusted to reflect authorized changes in the TDU’s
capital structure and cost of debt. Further, to reflect the effect of the CTC carrying charge
rate across the entirety of the TDU’s recoverable regulated assets, a composite rate of return
incorporating the CTC carrying charge rate may be applied to both the unsecuritized trueup balance and the TDU rate base. The composite rate of return shall be calculated as
follows:
Composite Pre-Tax Rate of Return = CTC Carrying Charge Rate * Unsecuritized True-up
Balance / (Unsecuritized True-up Balance + TDU Rate Base) + TDU Authorized Pre-Tax
Weighted-Average Cost of Capital * TDU Rate Base / (Unsecuritized True-up Balance +
TDU Rate Base)
(m) TDU/AREP true-up balance. The TDU shall bill the AREP for, and the AREP shall remit to the TDU, the
amount calculated pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, plus carrying costs. Carrying costs shall be
calculated in accordance with subsection (l) of this section and shall be calculated for the period of time from
the date of the true-up final order until fully recovered. The commission may reduce the TDU’s rates to
reflect the amounts due from the AREP.
(n) Proceeding subsequent to the true-up.
(1) The TDU shall file an application to adjust its rates within 60 days following the issuance of a final,
appealable order in its true-up proceeding. In the proceeding, the commission may adjust the TDU’s
rates and any CTC, in accordance with PURA §39.262(g), and any excess mitigation credit. The
commission may also allocate the recovery responsibility for such rates and any CTC to the TDU’s
customer classes.
(2) In the proceeding, the commission shall also consider adopting remittance standards, if necessary,
with respect to the credits or bills as among the TDU, the APGC, and the AREP.

The market value of an affiliated power generation company’s nuclear assets may be established by
compliance with any of the four methods of quantification specified in Public Utility Regulatory Act
(PURA) §39.262(h) and related requirements specified in §25.263 of this title (relating to True-up
Proceeding). If the electric utility or its affiliated power generation company values some of its assets
using the sale of assets or an exchange of assets, any remaining assets shall be combined in one or more
transferee corporations as described in PURA §39.262(h)(2) and (3) for purposes of determining their
market value, or the electric utility or its affiliated power generation company shall quantify its stranded
costs for remaining nuclear assets using the “excess costs over market” or ECOM method.

§25.265. Securitization by River Authorities and Electric Cooperatives.
(a) Application. This section applies to securitization transactions carried out by a river authority or electric
cooperative. A river authority or electric cooperative may adopt and use securitization provisions having the
effect of the provisions provided by the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), Chapter 39, Subchapter G,
to recover its stranded costs in accordance with this section.
(b) Definition of stranded costs.
(1) For electric cooperatives, the term “stranded costs” when used in this section shall mean “stranded
investment” as defined in PURA §41.002(3).
(2) For river authorities, the term “stranded costs” when used in this section shall mean the positive excess
of the combined net book value of generation assets over the combined market value of the assets,
taking into account all of the river authority’s generation assets, any above market purchased power
costs, and any deferred debit related to a utility’s discontinuance of the application of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards Number 71 (“Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation”) for generation-related assets.
(c) Quantification of stranded costs. Only those river authorities and electric cooperatives having positive
stranded costs as determined by this section may securitize such costs.
(1) For electric cooperatives, the board of directors has the exclusive jurisdiction to reasonably determine
the amount of the electric cooperative’s stranded investments.
(2) For river authorities, the governing body shall determine the amount of stranded costs using an
administrative model or other reasonable methodology, and such determinations shall be subject to
review and approval by the commission.
(d) Demonstration of tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers. A river authority or electric
cooperative may not utilize securitization financing to recover stranded costs unless it demonstrates that
securitization provides tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers greater than would have been achieved
absent the issuance of transition bonds. Such demonstration shall be performed on an asset-by-asset basis.
(e) Limit on amount of qualified costs to be securitized. The amount securitized may not exceed the sum of:
(1) the present value, calculated using a discount rate equal to the proposed interest rate on the transition
bonds, of the revenue requirement over the life of the proposed transition bonds associated with the
stranded costs sought to be securitized, and
(2) the costs of issuing, supporting, and servicing the transition bonds and any costs of retiring and
refunding existing debt of the river authority or electric cooperative.
(f) Use of proceeds. The proceeds of the transition bonds shall be used solely for the purpose of reducing the
amount of recoverable stranded costs as determined pursuant to this section, through the refinancing or
retirement of debt of the river authority or electric cooperative.
(g) True-up in the event of sale. A river authority or electric cooperative shall not overrecover its stranded
costs. If the recovery of an asset has been securitized through a sale of transition bonds, and the asset is
subsequently sold in a bona fide third-party transaction, then that asset shall be subject to true-up. To the
extent the total net value received from the sale of such asset exceeds its remaining book value, the river
authority or electric cooperative shall make refunds of the entire overcollected amounts, with interest, to its
ratepayers through an appropriate mechanism.

(h) Recovery of stranded costs. An electric cooperative or river authority may recover its securitized stranded
costs and the reasonable costs of issuing, supporting, and servicing the transition bonds through a transition
charge.
(1) Electric Cooperatives. An electric cooperative may recover its stranded costs through transition
charges from all existing or future customers, including the facilities, premises and loads of those
customers taking service from the cooperative as of May 1, 1999. An electric cooperative’s board of
directors has the exclusive jurisdiction to establish non-discriminatory transition charges reasonably
designed to recover the stranded costs over an appropriate period of time consistent with this section.
(2) River Authorities. A river authority may recover its qualified costs, as defined in PURA, Chapter
39, Subchapter G, including its stranded costs as defined herein, through transition charges reasonably
designed to recover the stranded costs over an appropriate period of time consistent with this section.
Payment of transition charges shall be made by customers taking service from the river authority as of
May 1, 1999 or those customers’ successors or assigns. Transition charges of a river authority in a
financing order adopted pursuant to this section shall be collected by the river authority, and such
charges shall not be subject to challenge provided that a river authority’s determination as to the
existence and amount of stranded costs has been approved under subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(3) Transition charges for both electric cooperatives and river authorities.
(A) The transition charge shall be sufficient to recover the stranded costs at the level, up to 100%,
deemed appropriate by the electric cooperative or river authority.
(B) Any transition charges adopted in accordance with this section shall constitute property rights,
as described in PURA, Chapter 39, Subchapter G, and otherwise conform in all material respects
to the transition charges provided by PURA, Chapter 39, Subchapter G.
(C) A river authority or electric cooperative may recover a transition charge notwithstanding the
expiration of a wholesale contract.
(i) Financing order. A cooperative or river authority which chooses to adopt and use securitization provisions
shall adopt a financing order consistent with this section.
(1) The financing order shall contain a finding that the present value total amount of revenues to be
collected under the financing order is less than the present value of the revenue requirement that would
be recovered over the remaining life of the stranded costs using conventional financing methods.
(2) The financing order shall have the effects of the provisions provided by PURA, Chapter 39,
Subchapter G. The effects shall be detailed in the financing order and shall include, but are not limited
to, provisions regarding property rights, set-off, security interests, no bypass, true-up, true sale, and
security interests.
(3) The financing order shall detail the stranded costs to be recovered and the period over which the
nonbypassable transition charges shall be recovered, which period may not exceed 15 years.
(4) The financing order shall detail how the proceeds from the transition bond are being used to refinance
or retire river authority or cooperative debt as prescribed by subsection (f) of this section.
(5) The financing order shall contain findings detailing the tangible and quantifiable benefits as prescribed
by subsection (d) of this section.
(6) The financing order shall contain a finding that the amount to be securitized does not exceed the limit
on qualified costs as prescribed in subsection (e) of this section.
(7) The financing order shall detail the allocation of the stranded costs to applicable classes and the
corresponding design of transition charges.
(8) The financing order shall provide for a structure and pricing of the transition bonds that results in the
lowest transition charges consistent with market conditions.
(9) The financing order shall include a mechanism requiring that transition charges be reviewed and
adjusted at least annually, within 45 days of the anniversary date of the issuance of the transition
bonds, to correct any overcollections or undercollections of the preceding 12 months and to ensure the

expected recovery of amounts sufficient to timely provide all payments of debt service and other
required amounts and charges in connection with the transition bonds.
(10) The financing order shall become effective in accordance with its terms, and the financing order,
together with the transition charges, shall thereafter be irrevocable and not subject to reduction,
impairment, or adjustment by further action of the cooperative, river authority or the commission,
except for periodic true-ups as specified in this section.
(11) Findings made by the governing body of the electric cooperative or river authority under the rules and
procedures described in this section shall be conclusive, subject to the provisions of subsection (c)(2)
of this section.

§25.271. Foreign Utility Company Ownership by Exempt Holding Companies.
(a) Certification to Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon request by a holding company which is
exempt under §3 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, codified at 15 United States Code 79,
the commission may certify to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the commission has the
authority and resources to protect ratepayers and that it intends to exercise its authority over holding
companies owning both a jurisdictional electric utility and a foreign utility company (FUCO) under the safe
harbor provisions of subsection (c) of this section or the case-by-case review provisions of subsection (d) of
this section. The commission may also notify the SEC that a previously-issued certification regarding a
requesting holding company will be ineffective prospectively.
(b) Policy goals. The commission will seek to protect the public interest in having electricity service available
to all citizens of the state at just, fair, and reasonable rates that are unaffected by investments by exempt
holding companies in foreign utility companies (FUCOs), while avoiding strictures that would place exempt
holding companies at a competitive disadvantage in international markets. The commission will consider
these policy goals in each decision whether to issue a certification or to notify the SEC that a previouslyissued certification is prospectively withdrawn.
(c) Safe harbor investments. The following safe harbor provisions apply to investments in FUCOs by exempt
holding companies that are affiliated with electric utilities subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the
commission:
(1) The commission must certify to the SEC that the commission has the authority and resources to
protect ratepayers subject to its jurisdiction and that it intends to exercise its authority, provided that
all holding companies of electric utilities that are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of this
commission must have filed with the commission corporate undertakings, signed under oath by an
authorized executive officer of the holding company agreeing to adhere to the covenants and to
make the filings specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(2) The holding company must adhere to the following covenants:
(A) That any indebtedness incurred in relation to the acquisition by the holding company, or
by any affiliate of the electric utility, of an ownership interest in a FUCO will be without
recourse to the electric utility;
(B) That the electric utility, the holding company, or any affiliate of the electric utility will not
enter into any agreements under the terms of which the electric utility is obligated to
commit funds in order to maintain the financial viability of a FUCO or an affiliate of the
electric utility investing in a FUCO;
(C) That the electric utility will not provide, directly or indirectly, any guarantees or other
forms of credit support for any funds borrowed by the holding company or an affiliate of
the electric utility in connection with the acquisition of any ownership interest in a FUCO;
(D) That the electric utility, the holding company, or any affiliate of the electric utility will not

be liable for the debts and/or liabilities of the FUCO incurred as a result of acts or omissions
of the FUCO;
(E) That the electric utility will maintain and provide a copy to the commission of its
accounting policies and procedures that assure that the electric utility is adequately and
fairly compensated by the holding company or an affiliate of the electric utility for any use
of the electric utility’s assets or personnel in furtherance of a FUCO;
(F) That the holding company provides the commission reasonable access to books and records
and financial statements, or copies thereof, of the FUCO or other affiliate doing business
with the FUCO, in English and stated in United States dollars, as the commission may
request to:
(i) review transactions between the electric utility and such FUCO or affiliate
pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Act §14.154; and
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(ii) review transactions between any affiliate and the FUCO if such affiliate also has
transactions directly or indirectly with the electric utility;
(G) That the holding company will file with the commission quarterly a report listing the total
amount of the aggregate investments by the holding company and its subsidiaries and the
percentage of the holding company’s consolidated net worth, from the company’s most
recent SEC form 10-Q, represented by such investments;
(i) “Aggregate investment” means all amounts invested, or committed to be invested,
in exempt wholesale generators located outside the United States (foreign EWGs)
and FUCOs, for which there is recourse, directly or indirectly, to the holding
company. Among other things, the term must include preliminary development
expenses that culminate in the acquisition of a foreign EWG or a FUCO.
(ii) Such report must be filed no later than ten days following the filing of the 10-Q
for the quarter.
(H) That in the event the holding company anticipates making any investment in a FUCO that
would result in the aggregate investment as defined in subparagraph (G) of this paragraph
of such holding company exceeding 30% of the consolidated net worth of such holding
company, the holding company must so advise the commission before a final commitment
to ownership of such FUCO is made;
(I) That the electric utility will provide, by March 31 of each year, a copy of the electric
utility’s three-year cash flow forecast;
(J) That the holding company will provide to the commission all SEC forms for reporting
information related to foreign EWG and FUCO investments, no later than ten days after

(K) That the holding company will promptly notify the commission whenever any of the
following occurs:
(i) It is unable to provide the certifications, undertakings, or documents provided for
in this paragraph;
(ii) The aggregate investment exceeds 30% of consolidated net worth;
(iii) The holding company’s operating losses attributable to its direct or indirect
investments in foreign EWGs and FUCOs exceeded 5.0% of consolidated retained
earnings during the previous four quarters; and
(L) That the holding company will comply with the informational filing requirements of
subsection (d) of this section in connection with a contemplated investment in a FUCO,
unless the commission finds good cause not to require the holding company to provide

(d) Other investments. For any occasion for which a holding company has undertaken to notify the commission
of an event specified in subsection (c)(2)(H) or (K) of this section, the following provisions apply:
(1) The holding company must provide the following information, to the extent such information is
reasonably available at the time of submission of the filing, at least 30 days before the date when it
anticipates making a final commitment to ownership of a FUCO not already covered by a
certification letter:
(A) A description of the proposed investment, including a description of the FUCO assets being
acquired, their geographical location, the form of the investment (partnership, joint venture,
direct purchase, etc.), the holding company’s percentage share of the investment, a
description of how the investment will fit into the corporate subsidiary structure, and any
other information reasonably necessary in the opinion of the holding company to provide
a complete overview of the nature of the proposed investment;
(B) Any financial requirements and/or commitments by the holding company or the electric
utility that will be made or assumed as a result of this investment; this information should
include, but is not limited to, an estimate of the amount of equity capital to be invested;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(C) Any debt obligations resulting from this investment which will provide recourse to the
holding company or the electric utility;
(D) The holding company’s general corporate objectives regarding diversification and foreign
utility investments, and the specific objectives of the proposed FUCO investment;
(E) A statement that the electric utility has effective written policies and accounting procedures
which insure that any use by the FUCO of assets or personnel of an affiliate of the electric
utility, or other transactions between the FUCO and an affiliate of the electric utility will
not negatively affect Texas ratepayers; and a statement that the electric utility will
demonstrate in each subsequent rate proceeding before the commission, and each
subsequent audit, that no FUCO investment increased the cost of capital or revenue
requirement of the electric utility;
(F) A calculation, based on the holding company’s most recent SEC Form 10-Q, of aggregate
consolidated holding company investments as defined in subsection (c)(2)(G) of this
section as a percentage of consolidated holding company net worth, stated both before and
after all asset transfers from any affiliate of the electric utility to FUCOs at fair market
value;
(G) A statement that the holding company will provide to the commission all SEC forms for
reporting information related to foreign EWG and FUCO investments, no later than ten
days after such forms are provided to the SEC; and
(H) Responses to questions, if any, contained on a commission prescribed form.
(2) The notification prescribed in this subsection may be submitted less than 30 days before the date
when the holding company anticipates making a final commitment to ownership of a FUCO not
already covered by a certification letter upon a showing of good cause. Good cause for purposes
of the preceding sentence must be deemed to include, without limitation, a representation that the
holding company lacked the information required to make a submission at an earlier date or a
representation that making the submission at an earlier date would have unreasonably jeopardized
the ability of the holding company to go forward with the contemplated investment.
(3) In its review of the information provided pursuant to this section, the commission will consider, among
other things, the number and magnitude of prior FUCO investments by the holding company, including
the diversity among the countries in which such investments are located and other differences between
such investments, and the magnitude of the proposed investment and its effect on the diversity of the
portfolio.
(e) Post-investment reporting. The electric utility must comply with the following post-investment reporting
obligations:
(1) With respect to any investment in a FUCO for which an informational filing was made pursuant to
subsection (d)(1) of this section, the electric utility or holding company must notify the commission
no later than ten days after the holding company makes a final commitment to ownership of a FUCO
that such a commitment has been made. Such notice must include any material corrections,
additions, and supplementation of previously-provided information; and
(2) For any FUCO investment covered by a certification, the electric utility or holding company must
notify the commission no later than 30 days after any material change in the circumstances or nature
of an investment in a FUCO. Such notice must include all appropriate corrections, additions, and
supplementation of previously-provided information. A material change would include, but is not
limited to, any change that would have an adverse impact of greater than 1.0% of consolidated net
worth most recently reported; full or partial divestiture of the investment; a catastrophic event that
destroys a significant amount of FUCO property or results in loss of life that could result in a
significant liability claim; a change in the laws or government policy having a material impact on
the FUCO; or an event which would place a significant restriction on the repatriation of earnings of
the FUCO.
(3) Unless included in SEC reports, each exempt utility holding company which directly or indirectly
holds an interest in FUCOs or foreign EWGs must provide the following information: A 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
consolidating statement of income of the exempt holding company and its subsidiary companies for
the last calendar year, together with a consolidating balance sheet of the exempt holding company
and its subsidiary companies as of the close of such calendar year.
(A) The information must be provided in English, monetary amounts in U.S. dollars, and
according to generally accepted accounting principles.
(B) Such information must be received by the commission annually no later than March 15.
(f) Commission standards for granting or maintaining certification.
(1) In general, the commission will issue and continue certification when the aggregate investment in
FUCOs and foreign EWGs is less than 30% of the holding company’s consolidated net worth, and
the company has satisfactorily provided the information and assurances set out in the preceding
subsections.
(2) With respect to any investment in a FUCO for which an informational filing was made pursuant to
subsection (d)(1) of this section, the commission must determine on a case-by-case basis whether
to issue a certification to the SEC or maintain a previously issued certification. The commission
must endeavor to make such a determination prior to the date when the holding company anticipates
having to make a final commitment to ownership of the FUCO. If the commission determines that
it does not intend to continue certification, it may inform the SEC that maintaining a previouslyissued certification would be inappropriate.
(3) The commission must notify the holding company requesting the certification or retention of
certification of its decision within 45 days of receiving the request. If no action is taken by the
commission within 45 days of receiving the request, the certification is deemed granted or affirmed.
(4) Any information submitted by a holding company pursuant to this section may be submitted by the
holding company under seal. Each page tendered under seal must have the words “Confidential
Information” typed or stamped on its face. The holding company must clearly identify each portion
of the application alleged to be Confidential Information; identify the exemption to the Public
Information Act, Texas Government Code Annotated, Chapter 552 (Vernon Supp. 1998), applicable
to the alleged Confidential Information; and provide a detailed explanation of why the alleged
Confidential Information is exempt from public disclosure under the Public Information Act. If the
commission receives a Public Information Act request for disclosure of Confidential Information,
then the Executive Director must promptly so notify the holding company. The Executive Director
must timely request an Attorney General’s opinion as to whether the information falls within any of
the exemptions identified in Subchapter C of the Public Information Act. The Executive Director
must promptly provide to the holding company a copy of an Attorney General opinion regarding
the claim of confidentiality. If an Attorney General opinion recommends disclosure of Confidential
Information, either in whole or in part, then the Executive Director must not release such information
for ten calendar days, in order to allow the holding company time to pursue any legal remedies that
it may have. The holding company may require the execution of an appropriate confidentiality
agreement prior to providing access to such confidential information to commission staff or any
other interested party. The form of any such confidentiality agreement must be approved by
commission staff legal counsel prior to filing and included with the informational filing.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
§25.272. Code of Conduct for Electric Utilities and Their Affiliates.
(a) Purpose. The provisions of this section establish safeguards to govern the interaction between utilities and
their affiliates, both during the transition to and after the introduction of competition, to avoid potential
market-power abuses and cross-subsidization between regulated and unregulated activities.
(b) Application.
(1) General application. This section applies to:
(A) electric utilities operating in the State of Texas as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory
Act (PURA) §31.002(6), and transactions or activities between electric utilities and their
affiliates, as defined in PURA §11.003(2); and
(B) transmission and distribution utilities operating in a qualifying power region in the State
of Texas as defined in PURA §31.002(19) upon commission certification of a qualifying
power region pursuant to PURA §39.152, and transactions or activities between
transmission and distribution utilities and their affiliates, as defined in PURA §11.003(2).
(2) No circumvention of the code of conduct. An electric utility, transmission and distribution utility,
or competitive affiliate shall not circumvent the provisions or the intent of PURA §39.157 or any
rules implementing that section by using any affiliate to provide information, services, products, or
subsidies between a competitive affiliate and an electric utility or a transmission and distribution
utility.
(3) Notice of conflict and/or petition for waiver. Nothing in this section is intended to affect or
modify the obligation or duties relating to any rules or standards of conduct that may apply to a
utility or the utility’s affiliates under orders or regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A utility shall file with
the commission a notice of any provision in this section that conflict with FERC or SEC orders or
regulations. A utility that is subject to statutes or regulations in any state that conflict with a
provision of this section may petition the commission for a waiver of the conflicting provision on
a showing of good cause.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms when used in this section shall have the following meaning
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
(1) Arm’s length transaction -- The standard of conduct under which unrelated parties, each acting
in its own best interest, would carry out a particular transaction. Applied to related parties, a
transaction is at arm’s length if the transaction could have been made on the same terms to a
disinterested third party in a bargained transaction.
(2) Competitive affiliate -- An affiliate of a utility that provides services or sells products in a
competitive energy-related market in this state, including telecommunications services, to the
extent those services are energy-related.
(3) Confidential information -- Any information not intended for public disclosure and considered to
be confidential or proprietary by persons privy to such information. Confidential information
includes but is not limited to information relating to the interconnection of customers to a utility’s
transmission or distribution systems, proprietary customer information, trade secrets, competitive
information relating to internal manufacturing processes, and information about a utility’s
transmission or distribution system, operations, or plans for expansion.
(4) Corporate support services -- Services shared by a utility, its parent holding company, or a
separate affiliate created to perform corporate support services, with its affiliates of joint corporate
oversight, governance, support systems, and personnel. Examples of services that may be shared,
to the extent the services comply with the requirements prescribed by PURA §39.157(d) and (g)
and rules implementing those requirements, include human resources, procurement, information
technology, regulatory services, administrative services, real estate services, legal services,
accounting, environmental services, research and development unrelated to marketing activity
and/or business development for the competitive affiliate regarding its services and products, 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
internal audit, community relations, corporate communications, financial services, financial
planning and management support, corporate services, corporate secretary, lobbying, and
corporate planning. Examples of services that may not be shared include engineering, purchasing
of electric transmission facilities and service, transmission and distribution system operations, and
marketing, unless such services are provided by a utility, or a separate affiliate created to perform
such services, exclusively to affiliated regulated utilities and only for provision of regulated utility
services.
(5) Proprietary customer information -- Any information compiled by an electric utility on a
customer in the normal course of providing electric service that makes possible the identification
of any individual customer by matching such information with the customer’s name, address,
account number, type or classification of service, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of
use, types of facilities used in providing service, individual contract terms and conditions, price,
current charges, billing records, or any other information that the customer has expressly requested
not be disclosed. Information that is redacted or organized in such a way as to make it impossible
to identify the customer to whom the information relates does not constitute proprietary customer
information.
(6) Similarly situated -- The standard for determining whether a non-affiliate is entitled to the same
benefit a utility offers, or grants upon request, to its competitive affiliate for any product or service.
For purposes of this section, all non-affiliates serving or proposing to serve the same market as a
utility’s competitive affiliate are similarly situated to the utility’s competitive affiliate.
(7) Transaction -- Any interaction between a utility and its affiliate in which a service, good, asset,
product, property, right, or other item is transferred or received by either a utility or its affiliate.
(8) Utility -- An electric utility as defined in PURA §31.002(6) or a transmission and distribution utility
as defined in PURA §31.002(19). For purposes of this section, a utility does not include a river
authority operating a steam generating plant on or before January 1, 1999, or a corporation
authorized by Chapter 245, Acts of the 67th Legislature, Regular Session, 1981 (Article 717 p,
Vernon’s Texas Civil Statutes). In addition, with respect to a holding company exempt under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) §3(a)(2), the term “utility,” as used in this section,
means the division or business unit through which the holding company conducts utility operations
and not the holding company as a legal entity.
(d) Separation of a utility from its affiliates.
(1) Separate and independent entities. A utility shall be a separate, independent entity from any
competitive affiliate.
(2) Sharing of employees, facilities, or other resources. Except as otherwise allowed in paragraphs
(3), (4), (5), or (7) of this subsection, a utility shall not share employees, facilities, or other resources
with its competitive affiliates unless the utility can prove to the commission prior to such sharing
that the sharing will not compromise the public interest. Such sharing may be allowed if the utility
implements adequate safeguards precluding employees of a competitive affiliate from gaining
access to information in a manner that would allow or provide a means to transfer confidential
information from a utility to an affiliate, create an opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair
competitive advantage, lead to customer confusion, or create significant opportunities for crosssubsidization of affiliates.
(3) Sharing officers and directors, property, equipment, computer systems, information systems,
and corporate services. A utility and a competitive affiliate may share common officers and
directors, property, equipment, computer systems, information systems and corporate support
services, if the utility implements safeguards that the commission determines are adequate to
preclude employees of a competitive affiliate from gaining access to information in a manner that
would allow or provide a means to transfer confidential information from a utility to an affiliate,
create an opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair competitive advantage, lead to customer
confusion, or create significant opportunities for cross-subsidization of affiliates
(4) Employee transfers and temporary assignments. A utility shall not assign, for less than one year, 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
utility employees engaged in transmission or distribution system operations to a competitive
affiliate unless the employee does not have knowledge of confidential information. Utility
employees engaged in transmission or distribution system operations, including persons employed
by a service company affiliated with the utility who are engaged in transmission system operations
on a day-to-day basis or have knowledge of transmission or distribution system operations and are
transferred to a competitive affiliate, shall not remove or otherwise provide or use confidential
property or information gained from the utility or affiliated service company in a discriminatory or
exclusive fashion, to the benefit of the competitive affiliate or to the detriment of non-affiliated
electric suppliers. Movement of an employee engaged in transmission or distribution system
operations, including a person employed by a service company affiliated with the utility who is
engaged in transmission or distribution system operations on a day-to-day basis or has knowledge
of transmission or distribution system operations from a utility to a competitive affiliate or vice
versa, may be accomplished through either the employee’s termination of employment with one
company and acceptance of employment with the other, or a transfer to another company, as long
as the transfer of an employee from the utility to an affiliate results in the utility bearing no ongoing
costs associated with that employee. Transferring employees shall sign a statement indicating that
they are aware of and understand the restrictions and penalties set forth in this section. The utility
also shall post a conspicuous notice of such a transfer on its Internet site or other public electronic
bulletin board within 24 hours and for at least 30 consecutive calendar days. The exception to this
provision is that employees may be temporarily assigned to an affiliate or non-affiliated utility to
assist in restoring power in the event of a major service interruption or assist in resolving emergency
situations affecting system reliability. Consistent with §25.84(h) of this title, however, within 30
days of such a deviation from the code of conduct, the utility shall report this information to the
commission and shall conspicuously post the information on its Internet site or other public
electronic bulletin board for 30 consecutive calendar days.
(5) Sharing of office space. A utility’s office space shall be physically separate from that of its
competitive affiliates, where physical separation is accomplished by having office space in separate
buildings or, if within the same building, by a method such as having offices on separate floors or
with separate access, unless otherwise approved by the commission.
(6) Separate books and records. A utility and its affiliates shall keep separate books of accounts and
records, and the commission may review records relating to a transaction between a utility and an
affiliate.
(A) In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or state and federal
guidelines, as appropriate, a utility shall record all transactions with its affiliates, whether
they involve direct or indirect expenses.
(B) A utility shall prepare financial statements that are not consolidated with those of its
affiliates.
(C) A utility and its affiliates shall maintain sufficient records to allow for an audit of the
transactions between the utility and its affiliates. At any time, the commission may, at its
discretion, require a utility to initiate, at the utility’s expense, an audit of transactions
between the utility and its affiliates performed by an independent third party.
(7) Limited credit support by a utility. A utility may share credit, investment, or financing
arrangements with its competitive affiliates if it complies with subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this
paragraph.
(A) The utility shall implement adequate safeguards precluding employees of a competitive
affiliate from gaining access to information in a manner that would allow or provide a
means to transfer confidential information from a utility to an affiliate, create an
opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair competitive advantage, lead to customer
confusion, or create significant opportunities for cross- subsidization of affiliates.
(B) The utility shall not allow an affiliate to obtain credit under any arrangement that would
include a specific pledge of any assets in the rate base of the utility or a pledge of cash
reasonably necessary for utility operations. This subsection does not affect a utility’s 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
obligations under other law or regulations, such as the obligations of a public utility
holding company under §25.271(c)(2) of this title (relating to Foreign Utility Company
Ownership by Exempt Holding Companies).
(e) Transactions between a utility and its affiliates.
(1) Transactions with all affiliates. A utility shall not subsidize the business activities of any affiliate
with revenues from a regulated service. In accordance with PURA and the commission’s rules, a
utility and its affiliates shall fully allocate costs for any shared services, including corporate support
services, offices, employees, property, equipment, computer systems, information systems, and any
other shared assets, services, or products.
(A) Sale of products or services by a utility. Unless otherwise approved by the commission
and except for corporate support services, any sale of a product or service by a utility shall
be governed by a tariff approved by the commission. Products and services shall be made
available to any third party entity on the same terms and conditions as the utility makes
those products and services available to its affiliates.
(B) Purchase of products, services, or assets by a utility from its affiliate. Products,
services, and assets shall be priced at levels that are fair and reasonable to the customers
of the utility and that reflect the market value of the product, service, or asset.
(C) Transfers of assets. Except for asset transfers implementing unbundling pursuant to
PURA §39.051, asset valuation in accordance with PURA §39.262, and transfers of
property pursuant to a financing order issued under PURA, Chapter 39, Subchapter G,
assets transferred from a utility to its affiliates shall be priced at levels that are fair and
reasonable to the customers of the utility and that reflect the market value of the assets or
the utility’s fully allocated cost to provide those assets.
(D) Transfer of assets implementing restructuring legislation. The transfer from a utility
to an affiliate of assets implementing unbundling pursuant to PURA §39.051, asset
valuation in accordance with PURA §39.262, and transfers of property pursuant to a
financing order issued under PURA, Chapter 39, Subchapter G will be reviewed by the
commission pursuant to the applicable provisions of PURA, and any rules implementing
those provisions.
(2) Transactions with competitive affiliates. Unless otherwise allowed in this subsection,
transactions between a utility and its competitive affiliates shall be at arm’s length. A utility shall
maintain a contemporaneous written record of all transactions with its competitive affiliates, except
those involving corporate support services and those transactions governed by tariffs. Such records,
which shall include the date of the transaction, name of affiliate involved, name of a utility
employee knowledgeable about the transaction, and a description of the transaction, shall be
maintained by the utility for three years. In addition to the requirements specified in paragraph (1)
of this subsection, the following provisions apply to transactions between utilities and their
competitive affiliates.
(A) Provision of corporate support services. A utility may engage in transactions directly
related to the provision of corporate support services with its competitive affiliates. Such
provision of corporate support services shall not allow or provide a means for the transfer
of confidential information from the utility to the competitive affiliate, create the
opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair competitive advantage, lead to customer
confusion, or create significant opportunities for cross- subsidization of the competitive
affiliate.
(B) Purchase of products or services by a utility from its competitive affiliate. Except for
corporate support services, a utility may not enter into a transaction to purchase a product
or service from a competitive affiliate that has a per unit value of $75,000 or more, or a
total value of $1 million or more, unless the transaction is the result of a fair, competitive
bidding process formalized in a contract subject to the provisions of §25.273 of this title
(relating to Contracts Between Electric Utilities and Their Competitive Affiliates).
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
(C) Transfers of assets. Except for asset transfers facilitating unbundling pursuant to PURA
§39.051, asset valuation in accordance with PURA §39.262, and transfers of property
pursuant to a financing order issued under PURA, Chapter 39, Subchapter G, any transfer
from a utility to its competitive affiliates of assets with a per unit value of $75,000 or
more, or a total value of $1 million or more, must be the result of a fair, competitive
bidding process formalized in a contract subject to the provisions of §25.273 of this title.
(f) Safeguards relating to provision of products and services.
(1) Products and services available on a non-discriminatory basis. If a utility makes a product or
service, other than corporate support services, available to a competitive affiliate, it shall make the
same product or service available, contemporaneously and in the same manner, to all similarly
situated entities, and it shall apply its tariffs, prices, terms, conditions, and discounts for those
products and services in the same manner to all similarly situated entities. A utility shall process
all requests for a product or service from competitive affiliates or similarly situated non-affiliated
entities on a non-discriminatory basis. If a utility’s tariff allows for discretion in its application, the
utility shall apply that provision in the same manner to its competitive affiliates and similarly
situated non-affiliates, as well as to their respective customers. If a utility’s tariff allows no
discretion in its application, the utility shall strictly apply the tariff. A utility shall not use customerspecific contracts to circumvent these requirements, nor create a product or service arrangement
with its competitive affiliate that is so unique that no competitor could be similarly situated to
utilize the product or service.
(2) Discounts, rebates, fee waivers, or alternative tariff terms and conditions. If a utility offers its
competitive affiliate or grants a request from its competitive affiliate for a discount, rebate, fee
waiver, or alternative tariff terms and conditions for any product or service, it must make the same
benefit contemporaneously available, on a non-discriminatory basis, to all similarly situated nonaffiliates. The utility shall post a conspicuous notice on its Internet site or public electronic bulletin
board for at least 30 consecutive calendar days providing the following information: the name of
the competitive affiliate involved in the transaction; the rate charged; the normal rate or tariff
condition; the period for which the benefit applies; the quantities and the delivery points involved
in the transaction (if any); any conditions or requirements applicable to the benefit; documentation
of any cost differential underlying the benefit; and the procedures by which non-affiliates may
obtain the same benefit. The utility shall maintain records of such information for a minimum of
three years, and shall make such records available for third party review within 72 hours of a written
request, or at a time mutually agreeable to the utility and the third party. A utility shall not create
any arrangement with its competitive affiliate that is so unique that no competitor could be similarly
situated to benefit from the discount, rebate, fee waiver, or alternative tariff terms and conditions.
(3) Tying arrangements prohibited. Unless otherwise allowed by the commission through a rule or
tariff prior to a utility’s unbundling pursuant to PURA §39.051, a utility shall not condition the
provision of any product, service, pricing benefit, or alternative terms or conditions upon the
purchase of any other good or service from the utility or its competitive affiliate.
(g) Information safeguards.
(1) Proprietary customer information. A utility shall provide a customer with the customer’s
proprietary customer information, upon request by the customer. Unless a utility obtains prior
affirmative written consent or other verifiable authorization from the customer as determined by the
commission, or unless otherwise permitted under this subsection, it shall not release any proprietary
customer information to a competitive affiliate or any other entity, other than the customer, an
independent organization as defined by PURA §39.151, or a provider of corporate support services
for the sole purpose of providing corporate support services in accordance with subsection (e)(2)(A)
of this section. The utility shall maintain records that include the date, time, and nature of
information released when it releases customer proprietary information to another entity in
accordance with this paragraph. The utility shall maintain records of such information for a 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
minimum of three years, and shall make the records available for third party review within 72 hours
of a written request, or at a time mutually agreeable to the utility and the third party. When the third
party requesting review of the records is not the customer, commission, or Office of Public Utility
Counsel, the records may be redacted in such a way as to protect the customer’s identity. If
proprietary customer information is released to an independent organization or a provider of
corporate support services, the independent organization or entity providing corporate support
services is subject to the rules in this subsection with respect to releasing the information to other
persons.
(A) Exception for law, regulation, or legal process. A utility may release proprietary
customer information to another entity without customer authorization where authorized
or requested to do so by the commission or where required to do so by law, regulation, or
legal process.
(B) Exception for release to governmental entity. A utility may release proprietary customer
information without customer authorization to a federal, state, or local governmental entity
or in connection with a court or administrative proceeding involving the customer or the
utility; provided, however, that the utility shall take all reasonable actions to protect the
confidentiality of such information, including, but not limited to, providing such
information under a confidentiality agreement or protective order, and shall also promptly
notify the affected customer in writing that such information has been requested.
(C) Exception to facilitate transition to customer choice. In order to facilitate the transition
to customer choice, a utility may release proprietary customer information to its affiliated
retail electric provider or providers of last resort without authorization of those customers
only during a period prescribed by the commission.
(D) Exception for release to providers of last resort. On or after January 1, 2002, a utility
may provide proprietary customer information to a provider of last resort without customer
authorization for the purpose of serving customers who have been switched to the provider
of last resort.
(E) Exception for release to State of Texas’ Division of Emergency Management.
Beginning January 1, 2011, a utility may provide proprietary customer information to the
State of Texas’ Division of Emergency Management, upon that agency’s request for
purposes of identifying the customer as a critical care residential customer pursuant to
§25.497 of this title (relating to Critical Load Industrial Customers, Critical Load Public
Safety Customers, Critical Care Residential Customers, and Chronic Condition Residential
Customers).
(2) Nondiscriminatory availability of aggregate customer information. A utility may aggregate
non-proprietary customer information, including, but not limited to, information about a utility’s
energy purchases, sales, or operations or about a utility’s energy-related goods or services. However,
except in circumstances solely involving the provision of corporate support services in accordance
with subsection (e)(2)(A) of this section, a utility shall aggregate non-proprietary customer
information for a competitive affiliate only if the utility makes such aggregation service available
to all non-affiliates under the same terms and conditions and at the same price as it is made available
to any of its affiliates. In addition, no later than 24 hours prior to a utility’s provision to its
competitive affiliate of aggregate customer information, the utility shall post a conspicuous notice
on its Internet site or other public electronic bulletin board for at least 30 consecutive calendar days,
providing the following information: the name of the competitive affiliate to which the information
will be provided, the rate charged for the information, a meaningful description of the information
provided, and the procedures by which non-affiliates may obtain the same information under the
same terms and conditions. The utility shall maintain records of such information for a minimum of
three years, and shall make such records available for third party review within 72 hours of a written
request, or at a time mutually agreeable to the utility and the third party.

(3) No preferential access to transmission and distribution information. A utility shall not allow
preferential access by its competitive affiliates to information about its transmission and distribution
systems.
(4) Other limitations on information disclosure. Nothing in this rule is intended to alter the specific
limitations on disclosure of confidential information in the Texas Utilities Code, the Texas
Government Code, Chapter 552, or the commission’s substantive and procedural rules.
(5) Other information. Except as otherwise allowed in this subsection, a utility shall not share
information, except for information required to perform allowed corporate support services, with
competitive affiliates unless the utility can prove to the commission that the sharing will not
compromise the public interest prior to any such sharing. Information that is publicly available, or
that is unrelated in any way to utility activities, may be shared.
(h) Safeguards relating to joint marketing and advertising.
(1) Joint marketing, advertising, and promotional activities.
(A) A utility shall not:
(i) provide or acquire leads on behalf of its competitive affiliates;
(ii) solicit business or acquire information on behalf of any of its competitive
affiliates;
(iii) give the appearance of speaking or acting on behalf of any of its competitive
affiliates;
(iv) share market analysis reports or other proprietary or non-publicly available
reports, with its competitive affiliates;
(v) represent to customers or potential customers that it can offer competitive retail
services bundled with its tariffed services; or
(vi) request authorization from its customers to pass on information exclusively to its
competitive affiliate.
(B) A utility shall not engage in joint marketing, advertising, or promotional activities of its
products or services with those of a competitive affiliate in a manner that favors the
affiliate. Such joint marketing, advertising, or promotional activities include, but are not
limited to, the following activities:
(i) acting or appearing to act on behalf of a competitive affiliate in any
communications and contacts with any existing or potential customers;
(ii) joint sales calls;
(iii) joint proposals, either as requests for proposals or responses to requests for
proposals:
(iv) joint promotional communications or correspondence, except that a utility may
allow a competitive affiliate access to customer bill advertising inserts according
to the terms of a commission-approved tariff so long as access to such inserts is
made available on the same terms and conditions to non-affiliates offering similar
services as the competitive affiliate that uses bill inserts;
(v) joint presentation at trade shows, conferences, or other marketing events within
the State of Texas; and
(vi) providing links between any of a utility’s websites and social media platforms,
and any of the websites and social media platforms of its competitive affiliates.
(C) At a customer’s unsolicited request, a utility may participate in meetings with a competitive
affiliate to discuss technical or operational subjects regarding the utility’s provision of
transmission or distribution services to the customer, but only in the same manner and to
the same extent the utility participates in such meetings with unaffiliated electric or energy
services suppliers and their customers. The utility shall not listen to, view, or otherwise
participate in any way in a sales discussion between a customer and a competitive affiliate
or an unaffiliated electric or energy services supplier.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
(2) Requests for specific competitive affiliate information. If a customer or potential customer
makes an unsolicited request to a utility for information specifically about any of its competitive
affiliates, the utility may refer the customer or potential customer to the competitive affiliate for
more information. Under this paragraph, the only information that a utility may provide to the
customer or potential customer is the competitive affiliate’s address and telephone number. The
utility shall not transfer the customer directly to the competitive affiliate’s customer service office
via telephone or provide any other electronic link whereby the customer could contact the
competitive affiliate through the utility. When providing the customer or potential customer
information about the competitive affiliate, the utility shall not promote its competitive affiliate’s
products or services, nor shall it offer the customer or potential customer any opinion regarding the
service of the competitive affiliate or any other service provider.
(3) Requests for general information about products or services offered by competitive affiliates
and their competitors. If a customer or potential customer request general information from a
utility about products or services provided by its competitive affiliate or its affiliate’s competitors,
the utility shall not promote its competitive affiliate or its affiliate’s products or services, nor shall
the utility offer the customer or potential customer any opinion regarding the service of the
competitive affiliate or any other service provider. The utility may direct the customer or potential
customer to a telephone directory or to the commission, or provide the customer with a recent list
of suppliers developed and maintained by the commission, but the utility may not refer the customer
or potential customer to the competitive affiliate except as provided for in paragraph (2) of this
subsection.
(i) Remedies and enforcement.
(1) Internal codes of conduct for the transition period. During the transition to competition,
including the period prior to and during utility unbundling pursuant to PURA §39.051, each utility
shall implement an internal code of conduct consistent with the spirit and intent of PURA
§39.157(d) and with the provisions of this section. Such internal codes of conduct are subject to
commission review and approval in the context of a utility’s unbundling plan submitted pursuant
to PURA §39.051(e); however, such internal codes of conduct shall take effect, on an interim basis,
on January 10, 2000. The internal codes of conduct shall be developed in good faith by the utility
based on the extent to which its affiliate relationships are known by January 10, 2000, and then
updated as necessary to ensure compliance with PURA and commission rules. A utility exempt
from PURA Chapter 39 pursuant to PURA §39.102(c) shall adopt an internal code of conduct that
is consistent with its continued provision of bundled utility service during the period of its
exemption.
(2) Ensuring compliance for new affiliates. A utility and a new affiliate are bound by the code of
conduct immediately upon creation of the new affiliate. Upon the creation of a new affiliate, the
utility shall immediately post a conspicuous notice of the new affiliate on its Internet site or other
public electronic bulletin board for at least 30 consecutive calendar days. Within 30 days of creation
of the new affiliate, the utility shall file an update to its internal code of conduct and compliance
plan, including all changes due to the addition of the new affiliate. The utility shall ensure that any
interaction with the new affiliate is in compliance with this section.
(3) Compliance Audits. No later than one year after the utility has unbundled pursuant to PURA
§39.051, or acquires a competitive affiliate, and, at a minimum, every third year thereafter, the
utility shall have an audit prepared by independent auditors that verifies that the utility is in
compliance with this section. For a utility that has no competitive affiliates, the audit may consist
solely of an affidavit stating that the utility has no competitive affiliates. The utility shall file the
results of each said audit with the commission within one month of the audit’s completion. The
cost of the audits shall not be charged to utility ratepayers.
(4) Informal complaint procedure. A utility shall establish and file with the commission a complaint
procedure for addressing alleged violations of this section. This procedure shall contain a
mechanism whereby all complaints shall be placed in writing and shall be referred to a designated
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 6/26/14
(P 41616)
officer of the utility. All complaints shall contain the name of the complainant and a detailed factual
report of the complaint, including all relevant dates, companies involved, employees involved, and
the specific claim. The designated officer shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint in writing
within five working days of receipt. The designated officer shall provide a written report
communicating the results of the preliminary investigation to the complainant within thirty days
after receipt of the complaint, including a description of any course of action that will be taken. In
the event the utility and the complainant are unable to resolve the complaint, the complainant may
file a formal complaint with the commission. The utility shall notify the complainant of his or her
right to file a formal complaint with the commission, and shall provide the complainant with the
commission’s address and telephone number. The utility and the complainant shall make a good
faith effort to resolve the complaint on an informal basis as promptly as practicable. The informal
complaint process shall not be a prerequisite for filing a formal complaint with the commission,
and the commission may, at any time, institute a complaint against a utility on its own motion.
(5) Enforcement by the commission. A violation or series or set of violations of this section that
materially impairs, or is reasonably likely to materially impair, the ability of a person to compete
in a competitive market shall be deemed an abuse of market power.
(A) In addition to other methods that may be available, the commission may enforce the
provisions of this rule by:
(i) seeking an injunction or civil penalties to eliminate or remedy the violation or
series or set of violations;
(ii) suspending, revoking, or amending a certificate or registration as authorized by
PURA §39.356; or
(iii) pursuing administrative penalties under PURA, Chapter 15, Subchapter B.
(B) The imposition of one penalty under this section does not preclude the imposition of other
penalties as appropriate for the violation or series or set of violations.
(C) In assessing penalties, the commission shall consider the following factors:
(i) the utility’s prior history of violations;
(ii) the utility’s efforts to comply with the commission’s rules, including the extent to
which the utility has adequately and physically separated its office,
communications, accounting systems, information systems, lines of authority, and
operations from its affiliates, and efforts to enforce these rules;
(iii) the nature and degree of economic benefit gained by the utility’s competitive
affiliate;
(iv) the damages or potential damages resulting from the violation or series or set of
violations;
(v) the size of the business of the competitive affiliate involved;
(vi) the penalty’s likely deterrence of future violations; and
(vii) such other factors deemed appropriate and material to the particular circumstances
of the violation or series or set of violations.
(6) No immunity from antitrust enforcement. Nothing in these affiliate rules shall confer immunity
from state or federal antitrust laws. Sanctions imposed by the commission for violations of this rule
do not affect or preempt antitrust liability, but rather are in addition to any antitrust liability that
may apply to the anti-competitive activity. Therefore, antitrust remedies also may be sought in
federal or state court to cure anti-competitive activities.
(7) No immunity from civil relief. Nothing in these affiliate rules shall preclude any form of civil
relief that may be available under federal or state law, including, but not limited to, filing a
complaint with the commission consistent with this subsection.
(8) Preemption. This rule supersedes any procedures or protocols adopted by an independent
organization as defined by PURA §39.151, or similar entity, that conflict with the provisions of
this rule.

Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
§25.275. Code of Conduct for Municipally Owned Utilities and Electric Cooperatives Engaged in
Competitive Activities.
(a) Purpose. To protect against anticompetitive practices, consistent with the provisions of the Public Utility
Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.157(e) and Chapters 40 and 41, the provisions of this section establish
safeguards to govern the interaction between the transmission and distribution business unit (TDBU), as
defined in subsection (c) of this section, of a municipally owned utility (MOU) or electric cooperative
(COOP) and its competitive affiliates, and establish specific anticompetitive standards to apply to the
activities of Bundled MOU/COOPS, as defined in subsection (c) of this section. It is intended by this section
that no MOU/COOP subject to this section shall engage in the following anticompetitive practices:
(1) Subsidize competitive activities directly or indirectly through rates charged for the provision of electric
service;
(2) Allow discriminatory access to transmission and distribution products and services;
(3) Allow preferential access to transmission and distribution-related information;
(4) Allow unauthorized access to confidential customer information; and
(5) Allow employees performing transmission and distribution functions to provide leads to or promote
the products of competitive affiliates or any persons providing competitive energy-related activities
on behalf of a Bundled MOU/COOP.
(b) Application.
(1) General application. This section applies to the TDBU of a municipally owned utility or an electric
cooperative (collectively referred to as MOU/COOP) operating in the State of Texas, and the
transactions or activities between the TDBU and its competitive affiliates, and to an MOU/COOP that
is conducting the activities of a TDBU and of a competitive affiliate on a bundled basis, provided that
each of the following conditions is met:
(A) The MOU/COOP has chosen to participate in customer choice pursuant to PURA §40.051(b) or
PURA §41.051(b).
(B) The competitive affiliate of an MOU/COOP or a Bundled MOU/COOP is providing electric
energy at retail to consumers in Texas outside its certificated retail service area. For the purposes
of this section, an MOU/COOP shall not be considered to be providing electric energy to retail
consumers outside its certificated retail service area if:
(i) the MOU/COOP was serving the area prior to the date of customer choice;
(ii) after receiving notice that the MOU/COOP or its affiliate is selling electric energy at
retail outside its retail service area, which identifies the service location, the
MOU/COOP or its affiliate promptly investigates and thereafter takes reasonable steps
to cease the provision of service outside its service area as soon as reasonably
practicable; or
(iii) there is a dispute concerning the service area boundary and no commission order
resolving the dispute has become final or the commission’s order is subject to appeal.
(2) Effect of unbundling on application. Pursuant to PURA §40.055 and §41.055 it is the discretion of
the governing body of the MOU/COOP to determine whether to unbundle any energy-related
activities, and whether to do so structurally or functionally. The MOU/COOP shall file with the
commission, in conjunction with the filing required by subsections (n)(1)(A) or (o)(3)(A) of this
section, a written declaration of whether it chooses to structurally or functionally unbundle or whether
it will provide services in a competitive market on a bundled basis. The written declaration may be
amended from time to time but no amendment shall be effective before it is filed with the commission.
The MOU/COOP shall comply with this section as follows:
(A) A structurally or functionally unbundled MOU/COOP shall comply with the provisions of this
subsection, as applicable to entities of its size. Subsection (o) of this section is not applicable to
a functionally or structurally unbundled MOU/COOP.
(B) A Bundled MOU/COOP shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (5) and (7)-(9) of this
subsection, subsection (n)(2)-(10), and subsection (o) of this section.

section;
(C) subsection (e) of this section, copies of contracts or agreements;
(D) subsection (f) of this section, tracking migration and sharing of employees;
(E) subsection (g) of this section, reporting deviations from the code of conduct; however, a midsized TDBU shall only report deviations with respect to the activities for which it is subject to
regulation under this section;
(F) subsection (h) of this section, ensuring compliance for new competitive affiliates;
(G) subsection (i) of this section, separation of a TDBU from its competitive affiliates; however,

value of the assets and the cost of employee time determined on the basis of aggregate percentage
of time devoted by the employee to the competitive function or transmission and distribution
function and do not include any discounts, rebates, fee waivers or alternative tariff terms and
conditions;
(I) subsection (j)(2) of this section, records of transactions;

(L) subsection (k)(2) of this section, products and services available on a non-discriminatory basis;
(M) subsection (l)(1) of this section, proprietary customer information;
(N) subsection (1)(2) of this section, nondiscriminatory availability of aggregate customer
information. A mid-size TDBU shall make aggregate customer information available to all nonaffiliates under the same terms and conditions and at the same price or fully allocated cost that
it is made available to any of its competitive affiliates, but is not otherwise subject to the
reporting requirements in subsection (l)(2) of this section.
(O) subsection (l)(3) of this section, no preferential access to transmission and distribution
information. A mid-size TDBU shall comply with this paragraph except to the extent 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
preferential access may not practicably be avoided due to cross-functional responsibilities of
employees or other operating constraints as reasonably determined by the mid-size TDBU;
(P) instead of the restrictions in subsection (m)(2) of this section, a mid-sized TDBU may participate
in joint marketing, advertising, and promotional activities with a competitive affiliate, provided
that the mid-size TDBU informs the customer that the competitive energy services to which the
promotional activities are directed are available from other providers as well as the mid-size
TDBU and makes available to the customer upon request a copy of the most recent list of
competitive energy service providers as developed and maintained by the commission;
(Q) instead of the restrictions in subsections (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this section, if a customer or
potential customer of a mid-size TDBU makes an unsolicited request for distribution service,
competitive service, or information relating to such services, the mid-size TDBU shall inform
the customer that competitive energy-related activities are available not only from the mid-size
TDBU but also from other providers. The mid-size TDBU shall make available to a customer
upon request a copy of the most recent list of competitive energy service providers as developed
and maintained by the commission and may make available telephone numbers and other
commonly available information; and
(R) subsection (n) of this section, remedies and enforcement.
(5) Duration of code application. This section applies to a TDBU and a Bundled MOU/COOP,
regardless of whether it is classified as large, mid-size or small, only so long as each of the conditions
of paragraph (1) of this subsection continue to be met.
(6) Report of energy system sales and declaration of code applicability. A report of total metered
electric energy (MWh) delivered through the TDBU’s system for sale at retail and wholesale, for the
average of the three most recent calendar years, shall be filed annually with the commission by each
MOU/COOP subject to the provisions of this section. The initial report shall be filed in conjunction
with subsection (n)(1) of this section. After the initial report filing, the report of energy system sales
shall be filed annually by June 1, and shall encompass the period from January 1 through December
31 of the preceding year. The annual report of energy system sales shall be filed under a control
number designated by the commission for each calendar year. Both the initial and annual reports of
energy sales shall include a statement from the MOU/COOP affirming that it is classified as either a
small, mid-size, or large TDBU.
(A) In the event that the MWhs delivered through the TDBU’s system increase so that a TDBU is
reclassified to a larger size, the TDBU shall notify the commission through the annual report of
energy system sales. The TDBU shall have one year from the date of the reclassification to
implement the applicable provisions of this section.
(B) Petition for exception to reclassification. Any TDBU may petition the commission for exception
to the size determination. Upon request, if a small TDBU is reclassified as a mid-sized TDBU,
the commission may consider an adjustment for growth based upon total Texas retail sales.
(7) No circumvention of the code of conduct. An MOU/COOP shall not circumvent the provisions of
PURA §39.157(e) or this section by using any affiliate to provide information, services, products, or
subsidies that would be prohibited by this section between a competitive affiliate and a TDBU. A
Bundled MOU/COOP shall not circumvent the provisions of PURA §39.157(e) or this section by
using any persons to provide information, services, products, or subsidies that would be prohibited by
this section between persons providing transmission and distribution service on behalf of the Bundled
MOU/COOP and persons providing competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the Bundled
MOU/COOP.
(8) Good cause exception. An MOU/COOP that is or may become subject to this section may petition
the commission at any time for an exception or waiver of any provision of this section on a showing
of good cause. Good cause may be demonstrated by showing that the cost or difficulty of achieving
compliance outweighs the benefit to be achieved or that there are other alternative actions that are
likely to produce reasonable results under the circumstances.
(9) Notice of conflict with other regulation and petition for waiver. Nothing in this section shall affect
or modify the obligation or duties relating to any rules or standards of conduct that may apply to an 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
MOU/COOP or its affiliates, whether competitive or noncompetitive, under orders or regulations of
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or
shall violate PURA, Chapters 40 and 41, subchapter C. An MOU/COOP shall file with the
commission a notice of any provision in this section that conflicts with FERC or SEC orders or
regulations. An MOU/COOP that is subject to statutes or regulations in any state that conflict with a
provision of this section may petition the commission for a waiver of the conflicting provision on a
showing of good cause.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms when used in this section shall have the following meanings
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
(1) Affiliate — An entity, including a business unit or division, that controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with, an MOU/COOP. Control means the power and authority to direct the
management or policies of an entity through directly or indirectly owning or holding at least a 5.0%
voting or ownership interest. Affiliate includes an entity determined to be an affiliate by the
commission after notice and hearing based on criteria parallel to those prescribed in PURA §11.006.
(2) Bundled MOU/COOP — An MOU/COOP that is conducting both transmission and distribution
activities and competitive energy-related activities on a bundled basis without structural or functional
separation of transmission and distribution functions from competitive energy-related activities and

which the MOU/COOP was subject to this section.
(e) Copies of contracts or agreements. A TDBU shall reduce to writing and file with the commission copies
of any contracts or agreements it has with its competitive affiliates. The filing of an earnings report does not
satisfy the requirements of this section. All contracts or agreements shall be filed by June 1 of each year as
attachments to the annual report of code-related activities required in subsection (d) of this section. In
subsequent years, if no significant changes have been made to the contract or agreement, an amendment sheet

(g) Reporting deviations from the code of conduct. A TDBU shall report information regarding the instances
in which deviations from this section were necessary to ensure public safety or system reliability pursuant to
this section. The information reported shall include the nature of the circumstances involved and the date of
the deviation. Within 30 days of each deviation relating to a competitive affiliate, the MOU/COOP shall
report this information to the commission and shall conspicuously post the information on its Internet site or
a public electronic bulletin board for 30 consecutive calendar days. Information regarding a deviation shall
be summarized in the MOU/COOP’s annual report of code-related activities.
(h) Ensuring compliance for new competitive affiliates. An MOU/COOP and a new competitive affiliate are
bound by this code of conduct, to the extent applicable, immediately upon creation of the new competitive
affiliate. The MOU/COOP shall post a conspicuous notice of any newly created competitive affiliates on its
Internet site or a public electronic bulletin board for 30 consecutive calendar days. Additionally, the
MOU/COOP shall ensure that its annual report of code-related activities reflects all changes that result from
the creation of new competitive affiliates.
(i) Separation of a TDBU from its competitive affiliates.
(1) Sharing of employees, officers and directors, property, equipment, computer and information
systems, other resources, and corporate support services. An MOU/COOP and its competitive
affiliate may share common employees, officers and trustees/directors, property, equipment, computer
and information systems, other resources, and corporate support services, if the TDBU implements
safeguards that the commission determines are adequate to preclude employees of a competitive
affiliate from gaining access to confidential information in a manner that would allow or provide a
means to transfer confidential information from the TDBU to the competitive affiliate, create an 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair competitive advantage, lead to customer confusion, or
create significant opportunities for cross-subsidization of a competitive affiliate.
(2) Employee transfers and temporary assignments.
(A) An MOU/COOP shall not assign to a competitive affiliate for less than one year employees
engaged in transmission or distribution system operations unless safeguards are in place to
prevent transfer of confidential information. TDBU employees engaged in transmission or
distribution system operations, including persons employed by a structurally unbundled service
company affiliate of the TDBU who are engaged on a day-to-day basis in or have knowledge of
transmission or distribution system operations and are transferred to a competitive affiliate, shall
not remove or otherwise provide or use confidential information or information gained from the
TDBU or affiliated service company, in a discriminatory or exclusive fashion to the benefit of
the competitive affiliate or to the detriment of non-affiliated electric suppliers.
(B) Movement of employees to a competitive affiliate may be accomplished either through the
employee’s termination of employment with the TDBU and acceptance of employment with the
CS or through a transfer to the CD as long as the transfer results in the TDBU bearing no ongoing
costs associated with that employee.
(C) Transferring employees shall sign a statement indicating that they are aware of and understand
the restrictions set forth in this section. The TDBU also shall post a conspicuous notice of such
a transfer on its Internet site or other public electronic bulletin board within 24 hours and for at
least 30 consecutive calendar days.
(D) Employees may be temporarily assigned to an affiliate or non-affiliated TDBU to assist in
restoring power in the event of a major service interruption or to assist in resolving emergency
situations affecting system reliability. Any such deviation shall be reported and posted on the
TDBU’s Internet site or other public electronic bulletin board within 24 hours and for at least 30
consecutive calendar days.
(3) Sharing of office space. A TDBU’s office space shall be physically separate from the office space of
its competitive affiliates. Physical separation is accomplished by having office space in separate
buildings or, if within the same building, by a method such as having offices on separate floors or with
separate access.
(4) Separate books and records. A TDBU shall maintain separate books of accounts and records from
those of any CS. In a proceeding under subsection (n)(3) of this section, the commission may review
records relating to a transaction between a TDBU and a CS. Costs of CDs, other than those costs
related to corporate support services, shall be segregated by account.
(A) In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, a TDBU shall record all
transactions with its CS whether they involve direct or indirect expenses, and all transactions
with CDs that relate to the transmission and distribution function.
(B) A TDBU shall prepare financial statements that are not consolidated with those of a CS.
(5) Limitations on credit support by a TDBU for a competitive affiliate. A TDBU and its affiliates
may share credit, investment, or financing arrangements with a competitive affiliate if the TDBU
implements adequate safeguards precluding employees of a competitive affiliate from gaining access
to information in a manner that would allow or provide a means to transfer confidential information
from the TDBU to the competitive affiliate or lead to customer confusion. Nothing in this section
shall impair existing contracts, covenants, or obligations between an MOU/COOP and its lenders and
holders of bonds issued on behalf of or by an MOU/COOP.
(A) MOU. In issuing debt related to competitive affiliates, an MOU shall be governed by and
maintained, operated, and managed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, including
the ordinances and resolutions authorizing the issuance of any form of indebtedness and the
provisions thereof, which require that funds reasonably necessary for operation and maintenance
expenses (including TDBU operation and maintenance expenses) have priority in any pledge of
gross revenues of the municipally owned utility system.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
(B) COOP. A COOP TDBU shall not allow a competitive affiliate to obtain credit under any
arrangement that would include a specific pledge of assets reasonably necessary for TDBU
operations or a pledge of gross revenues of the TDBU.
(j) Transactions between a TDBU and its competitive affiliates.
(1) Transactions with competitive affiliates. Except for transfers implementing unbundling, transfers
of property pursuant to a rate order having the effect of a financing order, credit support, and corporate
support services provided by a TDBU to its competitive affiliate, any transaction between a TDBU
and its competitive affiliate shall be accomplished at pricing levels that are fair and reasonable to the
customers of the TDBU and that reflect the approximate market value of the assets or the fully
allocated cost of the assets, services, or products, and that do not include any preferential discounts,
rebates, fee waivers or alternative tariff terms and conditions. Such transfers include, but are not
limited to, the following:
(A) sale or provision of products or services by a TDBU to its competitive affiliate;
(B) purchase or acquisition of products, services, or assets by a TDBU from a competitive affiliate;
or
(C) assets transferred from a TDBU to a competitive affiliate.
(2) Records of transactions. Each transaction between a TDBU and its competitive affiliates, other than
those involving corporate support services or transactions governed by tariffs of general applicability
filed at the commission or approved by the TDBU’s governing body, shall be reflected in a
contemporaneous written record of the transaction including the date of the transaction, name of the
competitive affiliate, name of a TDBU employee knowledgeable about the transaction, and description
of the transaction. Such records shall be maintained for three years.
(3) Provision of corporate support services. A TDBU may engage in transactions directly related to the
provision of corporate support services with its competitive affiliate. Such transactions shall be carried
out in such a way as to not allow or provide the means for the transfer of confidential information from
the TDBU to the competitive affiliate, the opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair competitive
advantage, customer confusion, or significant opportunities for cross-subsidization of the competitive
affiliate.
(k) Safeguards relating to provision of products and services.
(1) Tying arrangements prohibited. A TDBU shall not condition the provision of any product, service,
pricing benefit, or alternative terms or conditions upon the purchase of any other good or service from
the TDBU or its competitive affiliate.
(2) Products and services available on a non-discriminatory basis. Any product or service, other than
corporate support services or credit arrangements, made available by a TDBU to its competitive
affiliate shall be made available to all similarly situated entities at the same price and on the same basis
and manner that the product or service was made available to the competitive affiliate, provided
however, that such provision does not violate PURA §40.104 or §41.104, or the Texas Constitution,
Article III, section 52. Any service required to be provided in compliance with PURA §39.203 shall
be provided in a non-discriminatory manner and in accordance with the tariffs developed pursuant to
any commission rule implementing that section.
(l) Information safeguards.
(1) Proprietary customer information. Upon request by the customer, a TDBU shall provide a customer
with the customer’s proprietary customer information. Unless a TDBU obtains prior affirmative
written consent or other verifiable authorization from the customer as determined by the commission,
or unless otherwise permitted under this subsection, it shall not release any proprietary customer
information to a competitive affiliate or to any other entity, other than the customer, an independent
organization as defined by PURA §39.151, or a provider of corporate support services for the sole
purpose of providing corporate support services in accordance with subsection (j)(3) of this section.
The TDBU shall maintain records that include the date, time, and nature of information released when 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
it releases customer proprietary information to another entity in accordance with this paragraph. The
TDBU shall maintain records of such information for a minimum of three years and shall make the
records available for third party review within three business days of a written request or at a time
mutually agreeable to the TDBU and the third party. When the third party requesting review of the
records is not the customer, commission, or Office of Public Utility Counsel, the records may be
redacted in such a way as to protect the customer’s identity. If proprietary customer information is
released to an independent organization or a provider of corporate support services, the independent
organization or entity providing corporate support services is subject to the rules in this subsection
with respect to releasing the information to other persons.
(A) Exception for law, regulation, or legal process. A TDBU may release proprietary customer
information to another entity without customer authorization where authorized or requested to
do so by the commission or by law, regulation, or legal process. Nothing in this rule requires
disclosure of information that may be withheld from disclosure under Texas Government Code,
Chapter 552.
(B) Exception for release to governmental entity. Without customer authorization, a TDBU may
release proprietary customer information to a federal, state, or local governmental entity or in
connection with a court or administrative proceeding involving the customer or the TDBU,
provided however, that the TDBU shall take all reasonable actions to protect the confidentiality
of such information, including, but not limited to, providing such information under a
confidentiality agreement or protective order, and shall also promptly notify the affected
customer in writing that such information has been requested.
(C) Exception to facilitate transition to customer choice. In order to facilitate the transition to
customer choice, an MOU/COOP may release proprietary customer information to its
competitive affiliate without authorization of those customers, where either entity will be
exercising the function of retail electric provider or provider of last resort, provided however,
that such information may be released only during the six-month period prior to implementation
of customer choice, during the six-month period prior to implementation or expansion of a pilot
project, or such additional periods as may be prescribed by the commission.
(D) Exception for release to providers of last resort. On or after January 1, 2002, a TDBU may
provide proprietary customer information to a provider of last resort without customer
authorization for the purpose of serving customers who have been switched to the provider of
last resort.
(E) Exception for release to customer’s selected competitive retailer. Subject to demonstration by
the competitive retailer that the customer has selected that competitive retailer, a TDBU shall
release proprietary customer information for a particular customer to the competitive retailer
chosen by that customer in connection with provision of metering data or otherwise in
compliance with the Access Tariff applicable to the TDBU under PURA §39.203.
(2) Nondiscriminatory availability of aggregate customer information. A TDBU may aggregate nonproprietary customer information, including, but not limited to, information about a TDBU’s energyrelated goods or services. However, except in circumstances solely involving the provision of
corporate support services in accordance with subsection (j)(3) of this section, a TDBU shall aggregate
non-proprietary customer information for a competitive affiliate only if the TDBU makes such
aggregation service available to all non-affiliates under the same terms and conditions and at the same
price or fully allocated cost as it is made available to any of its competitive affiliates. In addition, no
later than 24 hours prior to a TDBU’s provision to its competitive affiliate of aggregate customer
information, the TDBU shall post a conspicuous notice on its Internet site or other public electronic
bulletin board for at least 30 consecutive calendar days, providing the following information: the name
of the competitive affiliate to which the information will be provided, the rate charged or cost allocated
for the information, a meaningful description of the information provided, and the procedures by
which non-affiliates may obtain the same information under the terms and conditions. The TDBU
shall maintain records of such disclosure information for a minimum of three years and shall make 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
such records available for third party review within three business days of a written request or at a
time mutually agreeable to the TDBU and the third party.
(3) No preferential access to transmission and distribution information. A TDBU shall not allow
preferential access by its competitive affiliates to information about its transmission and distribution
systems.
(4) Other limitations on information disclosure. Nothing in this rule is intended to alter the specific
limitations on disclosure of confidential information in the Texas Utilities Code, the Texas
Government Code, Chapter 552, or the commission’s substantive and procedural rules.
(5) Other information. Except as otherwise allowed in this subsection, a TDBU shall not share
information with competitive affiliates, except for information required to perform allowed corporate
support services unless the TDBU can prove to the commission that the sharing will not compromise
the public interest prior to any such sharing. Information that is publicly available, or that is unrelated
in any way to utility activities, may be shared.
(m) Safeguards relating to joint marketing and advertising.
(1) Name and logo. A TDBU may not, prior to September 1, 2005, allow the use of its corporate
trademark, name, brand, or logo by a CS on employee business cards or in any written or auditory
advertisements of specific services to existing or potential residential or small commercial customers
located within the TDBU’s certificated service area, whether through radio or television, Internetbased, or other electronic format accessible to the public unless the CS includes a disclaimer with its
use of the TDBU’s corporate trademark, name, brand, or logo. Such disclaimer of the corporate
trademark, name, brand, or logo in the material distributed must be written in a bold and conspicuous
manner or clearly audible, as appropriate for the communication medium, and shall state the following:
“{Name of CS} is not the same entity as {name of TDBU} and you do not have to buy {name of CS}’s
products to continue to receive quality services from {name of TDBU}.” A TDBU may allow the use
of its corporate name, brand, or logo by a CD in any context.
(2) Joint marketing, advertising, and promotional activities.
(A) A TDBU shall not:
(i) provide or acquire leads on behalf of its competitive affiliates;
(ii) solicit business or acquire information on behalf of its competitive affiliates;
(iii) give the appearance of speaking or acting on behalf of any of its competitive affiliates in
connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, other than
community economic development activities;
(iv) share market analysis reports or other types of proprietary or non-publicly available
reports relating to retail energy sales, including, but not limited to, market forecast,
planning, or strategic reports with its competitive affiliates; or
(v) request authorization from its customers to pass on information exclusively to its
competitive affiliate.
(B) A TDBU shall not engage in joint marketing, advertising, or promotional activities of its products
or services with those of a competitive affiliate in a manner that favors the competitive affiliate.
Such joint marketing, advertising, or promotional activities include, but are not limited to, the
following activities:
(i) acting or appearing to act on behalf of a competitive affiliate in any communications and
contacts with any existing or potential customers;
(ii) joint sales calls;
(iii) joint proposals, either as requests for proposals or responses to requests for proposals;
(iv) joint promotional communications or correspondence, except that a TDBU may allow a
competitive affiliate access to customer bill advertising inserts so long as access to such
inserts is made available on the same terms and conditions to non-affiliates offering
similar services as the competitive affiliate that uses bill inserts;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
(v) joint presentations at trade shows, conferences, or other marketing events within the state
of Texas; and
(vi) providing links from a TDBU’s Internet web site to a competitive affiliate’s Internet web
site.
(C) At a customer’s unsolicited request, a TDBU may participate in meetings with a competitive
affiliate to discuss technical or operational subjects regarding the TDBU’s provision of
transmission or distribution services to the customer but only in the same manner and to the same
extent the TDBU participates in such meetings with unaffiliated electric or energy services
suppliers and their customers. Representatives of a TDBU may be present during a sales
discussion between a customer and the TDBU’s competitive affiliate but shall not participate in
the discussion or purport to act on behalf of the competitive affiliate.
(3) Requests for specific competitive affiliate information. If a customer or potential customer makes
an unsolicited request to a TDBU for information specifically about any of its competitive affiliates,
the TDBU may refer the customer or potential customer to the competitive affiliate for more
information. Under this paragraph, the only information that a TDBU may provide to the customer or
potential customer is the competitive affiliate’s address and telephone number. The TDBU shall not
transfer the customer directly to the competitive affiliate’s customer service office via telephone or
provide any other electronic link whereby the customer could contact the competitive affiliate through
the TDBU. When providing the customer or potential customer information about the competitive
affiliate, the TDBU shall not promote its competitive affiliate or its competitive affiliate’s products or
services, nor shall it offer the customer or potential customer any opinion regarding the service of the
competitive affiliate or any other service provider.
(4) Requests for general information about products or services offered by competitive affiliates
and their competitors. If a customer or potential customer requests general information from a
TDBU about products or services provided by its competitive affiliate or the competitors of its CS or
CD, the TDBU shall not promote its competitive affiliate or its competitive affiliate’s products or
services, nor shall the TDBU offer the customer or potential customer any opinion regarding the
service of the competitive affiliate or any other service provider. The TDBU may direct the customer
or potential customer to a telephone directory or to the commission, or provide the customer with a
recent list of suppliers developed and maintained by the commission, but the TDBU may not refer the
customer or potential customer to the competitive affiliate except as provided for in paragraph (3) of
this subsection.
(n) Remedies and enforcement.
(1) Code implementation filing.
(A) Not later than 120 days prior to the implementation of customer choice by an MOU/COOP, a
TDBU shall file with the commission its plan for implementing the provisions of this section,
addressing all applicable requirements of this section in the context of its operations as they will
be conducted in the competitive retail market. The TDBU shall post notice of its filing on its
Internet site or a public electronic bulletin board for 30 consecutive days and shall provide copies
of the filing to requesting parties. Interested parties may file comments on the filing with the
commission within 30 days following the filing and shall provide copies of such comments to
the TDBU. Commission staff shall review the code implementation filing and provide to the
TDBU its comments and recommendations as to any suggested changes in the filing within 60
days following the date of the filing. The TDBU may amend its initial filing based on the
comments and recommendations and shall file any such amendments not later than 75 days
following the date of the initial filing. The filing provided for in this paragraph is not subject to
the contested hearings process, except upon complaint by an interested party or the commission
staff.
(B) In lieu of the implementation filing provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, an
MOU/COOP may file with the commission a statement that it does not at this time intend to
provide electric energy at retail to consumers in Texas outside its certificated retail service area 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
as provided for in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. Subsequently, if an MOU/COOP intends
to provide electric energy at retail to consumers in Texas outside its certificated retail service
area as provided for in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section, it shall file with the commission the
implementation filing provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph not later than 120 days
prior to the time it provides retail electric energy in Texas outside its certificated retail service
area.
(2) Informal complaint procedure. A TDBU or a Bundled MOU/COOP shall establish and file with
the commission a complaint procedure for addressing alleged violations of this section. This
procedure shall contain a mechanism whereby all complaints shall be placed in writing and shall be
referred to a designated officer or other person employed by the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP.
(A) All complaints shall contain:
(i) the name of the complainant;
(ii) a detailed factual report of the complaint, including all relevant dates, entities or divisions
involved, employees involved, and the specific claim.
(B) A complaint must be filed with the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP within 90 days of the
date the complaining party knew, or with diligent investigation should have known, that the
violation occurred, but in no event may a complaint be filed more than three years after the
violation occurred.
(C) The designated officer shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint in writing within five working
days of receipt. The designated officer shall provide a written report communicating the results
of the preliminary investigation to the complainant within 30 days after receipt of the complaint,
including a description of any course of action that will be taken.
(D) In the event the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP and the complainant are unable to resolve
the complaint, the complainant may file a formal complaint with the commission. In the event
the complainant advises the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP that the complainant does not
consider the complaint fully resolved by the course of action proposed by the TDBU or the
Bundled MOU/COOP then the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP shall notify the complainant
of his or her right to file a formal complaint with the commission and shall provide the
complainant with the commission’s address and telephone number. The informal complaint
process shall be a prerequisite for filing a formal complaint with the commission.
(E) A large TDBU or Bundled MOU/COOP shall report to the commission regarding the nature and
status of informal complaints handled in accordance with this paragraph in its annual report of
code-related activities filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. The information reported
to the commission shall include the name of the complainant and a summary report of the
complaint, including all relevant dates, companies involved, employees involved, the specific
claim, and any actions taken to address the complaint. Such information on all informal
complaints that were initiated or remained unresolved during the reporting period shall be
included in the annual report of code-related activities of the large TDBU or Bundled
MOU/COOP.
(3) Filing a complaint. Following the informal process, a formal complaint may be filed with the
commission alleging a violation of this section. No complaint shall be valid unless filed with the
commission within 30 days after the designated officer or employee of the TDBU or the Bundled
MOU/COOP mails its written report communicating the results of the preliminary investigation to the
complainant. Each complaint shall contain the name of the complainant and a detailed factual report
of the complaint, including all relevant dates, entities or divisions involved, employees involved, and
the specific claim. Additionally, each complaint shall identify the specific provisions of this section
that are alleged to have been violated, contain a sworn affidavit that the facts alleged are true and
correct to the best of the affiant’s knowledge and belief, and if the complainant is a corporation, a
statement from a corporate officer that he or she is authorized to file the complaint.
(4) Notification of complaint and opportunity to respond. The commission shall provide a copy of the
complaint to the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP. The TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP shall
respond to the complaint in writing within 15 days. The TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP and the 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
complainant shall make a good faith effort to resolve the complaint on an informal basis as promptly
as practicable.
(5) Settlement conference. Upon request by the MOU/COOP subject to the complaint, commission staff
shall conduct a settlement conference. At such settlement conference, each party, including the
commission staff, shall recommend what steps are necessary to cure any violation that it believes has
occurred. Discussions at the settlement conference, including the recommendations to cure the
violation, shall not be admissible at a hearing on the complaint.
(6) Opportunity to cure. The MOU/COOP shall have three months to cure the violation in accordance
with an agreement arising from the settlement conference or following a hearing. An MOU/COOP
may cure the violation in any reasonable manner as set forth in the settlement agreement or hearing,
including taking action designed to prevent recurrence of the violation or amending the rule or order.
(7) Enforcement by the commission. In the event the commission finds there has been a violation which
has not been reasonably cured, the commission may enforce the provisions of this section.
(A) The commission may recommend actions to be taken by the MOU/COOP within a prescribed
time, and if such actions are not taken, the commission may:
(i) seek an injunction to eliminate or remedy the violation or series or set of violations; or
(ii) limit or prohibit retail service outside the certificated retail service area of the TDBU or
the Bundled MOU/COOP until the violation or violations are adequately remedied. This
remedy shall not be applied in a manner that would interfere with or abrogate the rights
or obligations of parties to a lawful contract.
(B) In assessing enforcement remedies, the commission shall consider the following factors:
(i) the prior history of violations by the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP, if any, found
by the commission after hearing;
(ii) the efforts made by the TDBU or the Bundled MOU/COOP to comply with the
commission’s rules;
(iii) the nature and extent of economic benefit gained by the TDBU’s competitive affiliate or
the Bundled MOU/COOP;
(iv) the damages or potential damages resulting from the violation or series or set of
violations;
(v) the size of the business of the competitive affiliate involved; and
(vi) such other factors deemed appropriate and material to the particular circumstances of the
violation or series or set of violations.
(C) The commission may conduct a compliance audit of affiliate activities to ensure compliance with
the code of conduct.
(8) No immunity from antitrust enforcement. Nothing in these affiliate rules shall confer immunity
from state or federal antitrust laws. Enforcement actions by the commission for violations of this
section do not affect or preempt antitrust liability, but rather are in addition to any antitrust liability
that may apply to the anti-competitive activity. Therefore, antitrust remedies may also be sought in
federal or state court to cure anti-competitive activities.
(9) No immunity from civil relief. Nothing in these affiliate rules shall preclude any form of civil relief
that may be available under federal or state law, including, but not limited to, filing a complaint with
the commission consistent with this subsection.
(10) Preemption. This section supersedes any procedures or protocols adopted by an independent
organization as defined by PURA §39.151, or similar entity, that conflict with the provisions of this
section.
(o) Provisions for Bundled MOU/COOPs.
(1) Transactional safeguards relating to provision of products and services. To protect against
anticompetitive activities, the provisions of this subsection apply to all Bundled MOU/COOPs meeting
the qualifications set forth in subsection (b)(1)(A) and (B) of this section, regardless of whether the
MOU/COOP has any affiliates or competitive affiliates. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
(A) Tying arrangements prohibited. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall not condition the provision of
any transmission or distribution product, service, pricing benefit, or alternative terms or
conditions upon the purchase of any other good or service from the Bundled MOU/COOP.
(B) Products and services available on a non-discriminatory basis. Any product or service, other
than corporate support services or credit arrangements, made available by a Bundled
MOU/COOP to any third party or any persons providing competitive energy-related activities
on behalf of the Bundled MOU/COOP, shall be made available to all similarly situated entities
at the same price and on the same basis and manner that the product or service was made
available to any persons providing competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the Bundled
MOU/COOP, provided however, that such provision does not violate PURA §40.104 or §41.104,
or the Texas Constitution, Article III, section 52. Any service required to be provided in
compliance with PURA §39.203 shall be provided in a non-discriminatory manner and in
accordance with the tariffs developed pursuant to any commission rule implementing that
section.
(C) Cross-subsidization prohibited. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall not create significant
opportunities for cross subsidization of competitive energy-related activities with revenues from
distribution and transmission rates.
(D) Records of transactions involving competitive energy-related activities. A Bundled
MOU/COOP shall maintain segregated accounts and records of all transactions regarding the
provision of competitive energy-related activities consistent with the FERC chart of accounts or
a comparable tracking method. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, a
Bundled MOU/COOP shall separately record all transactions regarding the provision of
competitive energy-related activities and all transactions relating to the transmission and
distribution function. Such records shall include all expenses, whether direct or indirect, and at
the fully allocated cost to provide such competitive energy service. Such expenses shall not be
included in the Bundled MOU/COOP’s transmission and distribution rates.
(E) Transfer or use of assets or products to provide competitive energy-related activities. A Bundled
MOU/COOP shall implement procedures and safeguards to ensure that the transfer or use of
assets or products by a person providing competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the
Bundled MOU/COOP shall be accomplished at pricing levels that are fair and reasonable to the
customers of the transmission and distribution system of the Bundled MOU/COOP and at pricing
levels that do not include any preferential discounts, rebates, fee waivers or alternative tariff
terms and conditions.
(F) Provision of corporate support services. The provision of corporate support services by a
Bundled MOU/COOP to provide competitive energy-related activities shall be carried out in
such a way as to comply with the provisions of paragraph (2)(A)-(D) of this subsection, thereby
preventing the opportunity for preferential treatment or unfair competitive advantage, customer
confusion, or significant opportunities for cross-subsidization.
(G) No preferential access to transmission and distribution information. A Bundled MOU/COOP
shall not allow preferential access by any person providing competitive energy-related activities
on behalf of the Bundled MOU/COOP to information about its transmission and distribution
systems. Such information shall be provided as required in paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection.
(H) Sharing of personnel, facilities, and resources. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall implement
procedures and safeguards governing the sharing of personnel, facilities, officers and directors,
equipment, and corporate support services with persons providing competitive energy-related
activities on behalf of the Bundled MOU/COOP to ensure that confidential information is
protected, that there are no opportunities for preferential treatment or unfair competitive
advantage, that undue customer confusion will be prevented, and that no significant opportunities
for cross-subsidization are created. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall document the assignment of
shared employees engaged in both transmission or distribution system operations and the
provision of competitive energy-related activities. For shared employees, the tracking
documentation shall include the employees’ name, job title, scope of activities, and allocation of 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
time to the transmission and distributions functions and competitive energy-related activities.
The tracking documentation for shared employees shall be filed annually with the annual report
of code-related activities required by paragraph (3)(B) of this subsection.
(I) Marketing and advertising. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall implement procedures and safeguards
relating to the marketing and advertising of the Bundled MOU/COOP’s competitive energyrelated activities to prevent favoritism being shown to the competitive energy-related activities
provided by the Bundled MOU/COOP, to prevent customer confusion, to prevent the
inappropriate sharing of customer information, and to prevent significant opportunities for crosssubsidization.
(2) Informational safeguards. The following provisions apply to Bundled MOU/COOPs.
(A) Sharing of customer information. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall implement adequate safeguards
to preclude any persons providing competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the Bundled
MOU/COOP, or any other entities, from gaining access to information in a manner that would
allow or provide a means to transfer confidential information, create an opportunity for
preferential treatment or unfair competitive advantage, lead to customer confusion, or create
significant opportunities for cross-subsidization. Non-proprietary information possessed by the
Bundled MOU/COOP that is made available to any persons providing competitive energyrelated activities provided by the Bundled MOU/COOP shall likewise be made available to third
parties providing competitive energy-related activities at the Bundled MOU/COOP’s cost to
produce such information for the third party.
(B) Proprietary customer information. Upon request by the customer, a Bundled MOU/COOP shall
provide a customer with the customer’s proprietary customer information. Unless a Bundled
MOU/COOP obtains prior affirmative written consent or other verifiable authorization from the
customer as determined by the commission, or unless otherwise permitted under this
subparagraph, it shall not release any proprietary customer information to a person providing
competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the Bundled MOU/COOP or to any other
entity, other than the customer, an independent organization as defined by PURA §39.151, or a
provider of corporate support services for the sole purpose of providing corporate support
services. The Bundled MOU/COOP shall be permitted to release proprietary customer
information under the same terms and conditions as a TDBU as set forth in subsections (l)(1)(A)-
(E) of this section.
(C) Nondiscriminatory availability of aggregate customer information. A Bundled MOU/COOP
may aggregate non-proprietary customer information, including, but not limited to, information
about a Bundled MOU/COOP’s energy-related goods or services. However, except in
circumstances solely involving the provision of corporate support services, a Bundled
MOU/COOP shall aggregate non-proprietary customer information for a third party or any
person providing competitive energy-related activities only if the Bundled MOU/COOP makes
such aggregation service available to all non-affiliates and third parties under the same terms and
conditions and at the same price or fully allocated cost as it is made available to any person
providing competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the Bundled MOU/COOP.
(D) Requests for information. If a customer or potential customer of a Bundled MOU/COOP makes
an unsolicited request for distribution service, competitive energy-related activities, products or
services provided by an Bundled MOU/COOP, or for information relating to such products or
services, the Bundled MOU/COOP shall inform the customer that competitive energy-related
activities are available not only from the Bundled MOU/COOP, but also from other providers.
If the Bundled MOU/COOP provides the customer or potential customer with information about
competitive energy-related activities offered by the Bundled MOU/COOP, the Bundled
MOU/COOP must record and allocate the costs associated with the provision of such
information in the same manner as transactions involving the provision of competitive energy
related activities, in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection. The Bundled
MOU/COOP shall not offer the customer or potential customer any opinion regarding the service
of any other competitive energy service provider. Upon request, the Bundled MOU/COOP shall 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter K. RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective 3/28/01
make available to a customer a copy of the most recent list of competitive energy service
providers as developed and maintained by the commission and may make available telephone
numbers and other commonly available information. Such information shall also be made
available by the Bundled MOU/COOP to its transmission and distribution customers at the time
the Bundled MOU/COOP undertakes marketing to those customers of its competitive energyrelated activities.
(3) Reporting and auditing requirements. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall maintain and file the
following information so the commission can ensure that the Bundled MOU/COOP is not engaging in
any anticompetitive activities as a result of its competitive energy-related activities being bundled with
the transmission and distribution operation.
(A) Code implementation filing.
(i) Not later than 120 days prior to the implementation of customer choice by a Bundled
MOU/COOP, the Bundled MOU/COOP shall file with the commission a written
declaration that it will operate as a Bundled MOU/COOP and its plan for implementing
the provisions of this section. The plan shall address all applicable requirements of this
section in the context of operations as they will be conducted in the competitive retail
market. The Bundled MOU/COOP shall post notice of its filing on its Internet site or a
public electronic bulletin board for 30 consecutive days and shall provide copies of the
plan to requesting parties. The code implementation plan proposed by the Bundled
MOU/COOP shall be subject to a contested hearing process. Interested parties may file
comments on the filing with the commission. The commission shall issue an order either
approving the code implementation plan, approving the plan with modifications, or
rejecting the plan within 120 days.
(ii) In lieu of the implementation filing provided for in clause (i) of this subparagraph, a
Bundled MOU/COOP may file with the commission a statement that it does not at this
time intend to provide electric energy at retail to customers in Texas outside its
certificated retail service area as provided for in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section.
Subsequently, if a Bundled MOU/COOP intends to provide electric energy at retail to
consumers in Texas outside its certificated retail service area as provided for in
subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section, it shall file the implementation filing provided for in
clause (i) of this subparagraph with the commission not later than 120 days prior to the
time it intends to provide retail electric energy in Texas outside its certificated retail
service area.
(B) Annual report of code-related activities. A report of activities related to this subsection shall be
filed annually with the commission under a control number designated by the commission. The
report shall be filed by June 1 and shall encompass the period from January 1 through December
31 of the preceding year. The report shall contain detailed information on how the Bundled
MOU/COOP met each of the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection and any
deviations from the actions set forth in the initial code compliance filing. Commission staff shall
review the annual report of code-related activities. The filing provided for in this paragraph is
not subject to the contested hearings process, except upon complaint by an interested party or
the commission staff.
(C) Copies of contracts or agreements. A Bundled MOU/COOP shall reduce to writing and file with
the commission copies of any contracts or agreements it has with any persons providing
competitive energy-related activities on behalf of the Bundled MOU/COOP. The Bundled
MOU/COOP does not have to produce any contracts it has with third parties if such contracts
were negotiated on an arm’s length basis. The requirements of this section are not satisfied by
the filing of an earnings report. All contracts or agreements shall be filed by June 1 of each year
as attachments to the annual report of code-related activities required in subparagraph (B) of this
paragraph. In subsequent years, if no significant changes have been made to the contract or
agreement, an amendment sheet may be filed in lieu of refiling the entire contract or agreement.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS

Effective 3/28/01
(D) Compliance audits. No later than one year after the Bundled MOU/COOP becomes subject to
this section as set forth in subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and, at a minimum, every
third year thereafter, the Bundled MOU/COOP shall have an audit prepared by independent
auditors that verifies that the Bundled MOU/COOP is in compliance with this section. The
Bundled MOU/COOP shall file the results of each audit with the commission within one month
of the audit’s completion.
(4) Remedies and enforcement. Bundled MOU/COOPs shall be subject to the provisions of subsection
(n)(2)-(10) of this section on the same terms and conditions as the TDBU.

Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
§25.301. Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts.
(a) Duties of electric utilities.
(1) Each electric utility collecting funds for a nuclear decommissioning trust must assure that the
nuclear decommissioning trust is managed so that the funds are secure and earn a reasonable return;
and, that the funds provided from the utility’s cost of service, plus the amounts earned from
investment of the funds, will be available at the time of decommissioning.
(2) Each electric utility collecting funds for a nuclear decommissioning trust must place the funds in an
external, irrevocable trust fund. The utility must appoint an institutional trustee and may appoint an
investment manager(s). Unless otherwise specified in subsection (b) of this section, the Texas Trust
Code controls the administration and management of the nuclear decommissioning trusts, except
that the appointed trustee(s) need not be qualified to exercise trust powers in Texas.
(3) The utility must retain the right to replace the trustee with or without cause. In appointing a trustee,
the electric utility must have the following duties, which will be of a continuing nature:
(A) A duty to determine whether the trustee’s fee schedule for administering the trust is
reasonable, when compared to other institutional trustees rendering similar services, and
meets the requirement of subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section;
(B) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past administration of trusts by the trustee
has been reasonable;
(C) A duty to investigate and determine whether the financial stability and strength of the
trustee is adequate;

agreement and this section as it relates to trustees; and,
(E) A duty to investigate any other factors which may bear on whether the trustee is suitable.
(4) The utility must retain the right to replace the investment manager with or without cause. In appointing
an investment manager, the utility must have the following duties, which will be of a continuing nature:
(A) A duty to determine whether the investment manager’s fee schedule for investment
management services is reasonable, when compared to other such managers, and meets the
requirement of subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section;
(B) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past performance of the investment
manager in managing investments has been reasonable;
(C) A duty to investigate and determine whether the financial stability and strength of the
investment manager is adequate for purposes of liability;
(D) A duty to investigate and determine whether the investment manager has complied with
the investment management agreement and this section as it relates to investments; and,
(E) A duty to investigate any other factors which may bear on whether the investment manager
is suitable.
(b) Agreements between the electric utility and the institutional trustee or investment manager.
(1) The utility must execute an agreement with the institutional trustee. The agreement must include
the restrictions in subparagraphs (A) - (E) of this paragraph and may include additional restrictions
on the trustee. An electric utility must not grant the trustee powers that are greater than those
provided to trustees under the Texas Trust Code or that are inconsistent with the limitations of this
section.
(A) The interest earned on the corpus of the trust becomes part of the trust corpus. A trustee
owes the same duties with regard to the interest earned on the corpus as are owed with
regard to the corpus of the trust.
(B) A trustee must have a continuing duty to review the trust portfolio for compliance with
investment guidelines and governing regulations.
(C) A trustee must not lend funds from the decommissioning trust with itself, its officers, or its
directors.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(D) A trustee must not invest or reinvest decommissioning trust funds in instruments issued by
the trustee, except for time deposits, demand deposits, or money market accounts of the
trustee. However, investments of a decommissioning trust may include mutual funds that
contain securities issued by the trustee if the securities of the trustee constitute no more
than five percent of the fair market value of the assets of such mutual funds at the time of
the investment.
(E) The agreement must comply with all applicable requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
(2) The utility must execute an agreement with the investment manager. (If the trustee performs
investment management functions, the contractual provisions governing those functions must be
included in either the trust agreement or a separate investment management agreement.) The
agreement must include the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (A) - (E) of this paragraph and
may include additional restrictions on the manager. An electric utility must not grant the manager
powers that are greater than those provided to trustees under the Texas Trust Code or that are
inconsistent with the limitations of this section.
(A) An investment manager must, in investing and reinvesting the funds in the trust, comply
with subsection (c) of this section.
(B) The interest earned on the corpus of the trust becomes part of the trust corpus. An
investment manager owes the same duties with regard to the interest earned on the corpus
as are owed with regard to the corpus of the trust.
(C) An investment manager must have a continuing duty to review the trust portfolio to
determine the appropriateness of the investments.
(D) An investment manager must not invest funds from the decommissioning trust with itself,
its officers, or its directors.
(E) The agreement must comply with all applicable requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
(3) A copy of the trust agreement, any investment management agreement, and any amendments must
be filed with the commission within 30 days after the execution or modification of the agreement,
and copies provided to the commission’s Legal Division and Rate Regulation Division and the
Office of Public Utility Counsel. All previously executed agreements and amendments must be filed
within 30 days of the effective date of this section.
(4) Within 90 days after the effective date of this section, a utility that is a party to a trust agreement or
an investment management agreement that is not in compliance with this section must revise the
agreement to comply with this section.
(c) Trust investments.
(1) Investment portfolio goals. The funds should be invested consistent with the following goals. The
utility may apply additional prudent investment goals to the funds so long as they are not
inconsistent with the stated goals of this subsection.
(A) The funds should be invested with a goal of earning a reasonable return commensurate
with the need to preserve the value of the assets of the trusts.
(B) In keeping with prudent investment practices, the portfolio of securities held in the
decommissioning trust must be diversified to the extent reasonably feasible given the size
of the trust.
(C) Asset allocation and the acceptable risk level of the portfolio should take into account
market conditions, the time horizon remaining before the commencement and completion
of decommissioning, and the funding status of the trust. While maintaining an acceptable
risk level consistent with the goal in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the investment
emphasis when the remaining life of the liability, as defined in paragraph (2)(F)(iv) of this
subsection, exceeds five years should be to maximize net long-term earnings. The
investment emphasis in the remaining investment period of the trust should be on current
income and the preservation of the fund’s assets.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(D) In selecting investments, the impact of the investment on the portfolio’s volatility and
expected return net of fees, commissions, expenses and taxes should be considered.
(2) General requirements. The following requirements must apply to all decommissioning trusts.
Where a utility has multiple trusts for a single generating unit, the restrictions contained in this
subsection apply to all trusts in the aggregate for that generating unit. For purposes of this section,
a commingled fund is defined as a professionally managed investment fund of fixed-income or
equity securities established by an investment company regulated by the Securities Exchange
Commission or a bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
(A) Fees limitation. The total trustee and investment manager fees paid on an annual basis by
the utility for the entire portfolio including commingled funds must not exceed 0.7% of the
entire portfolio’s average annual balance.
(B) Diversification. For the purpose of this subparagraph, a commingled or mutual fund is not
considered a security; rather, the diversification standard applies to all securities, including
the individual securities held in commingled or mutual funds. Once the portfolio of
securities (including commingled funds) held in the decommissioning trust(s) contains
securities with an aggregate value in excess of $20 million, it must be diversified such that:
(i) no more than 5.0 % of the securities held may be issued by one entity, with the
exception of the federal government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and;
(ii) the portfolio must contain at least 20 different issues of securities. Municipal
securities and real estate investments must be diversified as to geographic region.
(C) Qualified trusts. The utility may invest the decommissioning funds by means of qualified
or unqualified nuclear decommissioning trusts; however, the utility must, to the extent
permitted by the Internal Revenue Service, invest its decommissioning funds in “qualified”
nuclear decommissioning trusts, in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service Code
§468A.
(D) Derivatives. The use of derivative securities in the trust is limited to those whose purpose
is to enhance returns of the trust without a corresponding increase in risk or to reduce risk
of the portfolio. Derivatives may not be used to increase the value of the portfolio by any
amount greater than the value of the underlying securities. Prohibited derivative securities
include, but are not limited to, mortgage strips; inverse floating rate securities; leveraged
investments or internally leveraged securities; residual and support tranches of
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations; tiered index bonds or other structured notes whose
return characteristics are tied to non-market events; uncovered call/put options; large
counter-party risk through over-the-counter options, forwards and swaps; and instruments
with similar high-risk characteristics.
(E) The use of leverage (borrowing) to purchase securities or the purchase of securities on
margin for the trust is prohibited.
(F) Investment limits in equity securities. The following investment limits must apply to the
percentage of the aggregate market value of all non-fixed income investments relative to
the total portfolio market value.
(i) Except as noted in clause (ii), when the weighted average remaining life of the
liability exceeds 5 years, the equity cap is 60%;
(ii) When the weighted average remaining life of the liability ranges between 5 years
and 2.5 years, the equity cap must be 30%. Additionally, during all years in which
expenditures for decommissioning the nuclear units occur, the equity cap must
also be 30%;
(iii) When the weighted average remaining life of the liability is less than 2.5 years,
the equity cap must be 0%;
(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the weighted average remaining life in any
given year is defined as the weighted average of years between the given year and
the years of each decommissioning outlay, where the weights are based on each 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
year’s expected decommissioning expenditures divided by the amount of the
remaining liability in that year; and
(v) Should the market value of non-fixed income investments, measured monthly,
exceed the appropriate cap due to market fluctuations, the utility must, as soon as
practicable, reduce the market value of the non-fixed income investments below
the cap. Such reductions may be accomplished by investing all future
contributions to the fund in debt securities as is necessary to reduce the market
value of the non-fixed income investments below the cap, or if prudent, by the
sale of equity securities.
(G) A decommissioning trust must not invest in securities issued by the electric utility
collecting the funds or any of its affiliates; however, investments of a decommissioning
trust may include commingled funds that contain securities issued by the electric utility if
the securities of the utility constitute no more than 5.0% of the fair market value of the
assets of such commingled funds at the time of the investment.
(3) Specific investment restrictions. The following restrictions must apply to all decommissioning
trusts. Where a utility has multiple trusts for a single generating unit, the restrictions contained in
this subsection apply to all trusts in the aggregate for that generating unit.
(A) Fixed-income investments. A decommissioning trust must not invest trust funds in
corporate or municipal debt securities that have a bond rating below investment grade
(below “BBB-” by Standard and Poor’s Corporation or “Baa3” by Moody’s Investor’s
Service) at the time that the securities are purchased and must reexamine the
appropriateness of continuing to hold a particular debt security if the debt rating of the
company in question falls below investment grade at some time after the debt security has
been purchased. Commingled funds may contain some below investment grade bonds;
however, the overall portfolio of debt instruments must have a quality level, measured
quarterly, not below a “AA” grade by Standard and Poor’s Corporation or “Aa2” by
Moody’s Investor’s Service. In calculating the quality of the overall portfolio, debt
securities issued by the federal government must be considered as having a “AAA” rating.
(B) Equity investments.
(i) At least 70% of the aggregate market value of the equity portfolio, including the
individual securities in commingled funds, must have a quality ranking from a
major rating service such as the earnings and dividend ranking for common stock
by Standard and Poor’s or the quality rating of Ford Investor Services. Further,
the overall portfolio of ranked equities must have a weighted average quality
rating equivalent to the composite rating of the Standard and Poor’s 500 index
assuming equal weighting of each ranked security in the index. If the quality
rating, measured quarterly, falls below the minimum quality standard, the utility
must as soon as practicable and prudent to do so, increase the quality level of the
equity portfolio to the required level.
(ii) A decommissioning trust must not invest in equity securities where the issuer has
a capitalization of less than $100 million.
(C) Commingled funds. The following guidelines must apply to the investments made through
commingled funds. Examples of commingled funds appropriate for investment by nuclear
decommissioning trust funds include United States equity-indexed funds, actively
managed United States equity funds, balanced funds, bond funds, real estate investment
trusts, and international funds.
(i) The commingled funds should be selected consistent with the goals specified in
paragraph (1) and the requirements in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(ii) In evaluating the appropriateness of a particular commingled fund, the utility has
the following duties, which must be of a continuing nature:
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 7/19/2023
(P 54844)
(I) A duty to determine whether the fund manager’s fee schedule for
managing the fund is reasonable, when compared to fee schedules of
other such managers;
(II) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past performance of the
investment manager in managing the commingled fund has been
reasonable relative to prudent investment and utility decommissioning
trust practices and standards; and
(III) A duty to investigate the reasonableness of the net after-tax return and
risk of the fund relative to similar funds, and the appropriateness of the
fund within the entire decommissioning trust investment portfolio.
(iii) The payment of load fees must be avoided.
(iv) Commingled funds focused on specific market sectors or concentrated in a few
holdings must be used only as necessary to balance the trust’s overall investment
portfolio mix.

Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
§25.303. Nuclear Decommissioning Following the Transfer of Texas Jurisdictional Nuclear Generating
Plant Assets.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this rule is to:
(1) delineate the rights and obligations of the transferor and the Transferee Companies involved in a
transfer of Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant assets for which decommissioning funds
will continue to be collected from retail customers pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act
(PURA) §39.205, as well as the obligations of the utility responsible for collecting the
decommissioning funds;
(2) prescribe a utility’s continuing responsibility for collecting funds through its rates for nuclear
decommissioning trust funds for the benefit of the Transferee Company;
(3) protect the nuclear decommissioning trust funds so that the funds collected from customers through
the Collecting Utility’s nonbypassable charge, plus the amounts earned from investment of the
funds, will be available for decommissioning, in the event of a transfer of the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds;
(4) minimize the amounts collected from customers for nuclear decommissioning by maximizing net
earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds through prudent investment of such funds, in
accordance with the guidelines set out in subsection (e)(3)(A)(iii) of this section, and achieving
optimum tax efficiency, in accordance with subsection (e)(3)(B)(iii) of this section.
(b) Application. This rule supersedes §25.231(b)(1)(F) of this title (relating to Cost of Service) and §25.301 of
this title (relating to Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts) for electric utilities that have completed their business
separation pursuant to PURA §39.051 or that otherwise transfer Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant
assets, including the associated nuclear decommissioning trust funds, to another entity. This rule applies to:
(1) an electric utility or a power generation company that transfers its Texas jurisdictional nuclear
generating plant assets, including any associated nuclear decommissioning trust funds, to another
entity;
(2) a utility that is responsible for collecting revenue for the decommissioning of Texas jurisdictional
nuclear generating plant assets that have been transferred to another entity; and
(3) a Transferee Company.
(c) Definitions.
(1) Transferor Company—An electric utility, its successor in interest, or any power generation company
that transfers Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant assets, including any associated nuclear
decommissioning trust funds collected from customers.
(2) Transferee Company—An entity or its successor in interest to which Texas jurisdictional nuclear
decommissioning generating plant assets, including the associated nuclear decommissioning trust
funds, are transferred from a Transferor Company. For purposes of this section, a municipality or
an electric cooperative may be a Transferee Company.
(3) Collecting Utility—The electric utility or transmission and distribution utility responsible for
collecting the decommissioning funds from customers and depositing them into the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds. The Collecting Utility may or may not be the Transferor Company.
(4) Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds—Funds that are contained in one or more external and
irrevocable trusts created for the purpose of protecting and holding revenue collected under cost-ofservice rate regulation to cover the costs of decommissioning a Texas jurisdictional nuclear
generating plant at the end of its useful life.
(5) Decommissioning Funds Collection Agreement—An agreement between or agreements among the
Collecting Utility, the Transferor Company (if different from the Collecting Utility), and the
Transferee Company that govern the transfer of responsibility for administration of the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds, the collection of decommissioning revenues from utility customers,
and the remittance of the funds to the nuclear decommissioning trust.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
(d) Transfer of Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds.
(1) Prior to the closing of any transaction involving the transfer of nuclear decommissioning trust funds:
(A) The Collecting Utility, the Transferor Company (if different from the Collecting Utility),
and the Transferee Company shall jointly submit for the commission’s review the proposed
decommissioning funds collection agreement(s) and the proposed agreements with the
institutional trustee and investment manager(s) of the decommissioning trust, and copies
shall be provided to the commission’s Legal and Enforcement Division and Financial
Review Division. The Collecting Utility or Transferee Company may request the transfer
of responsibility for administration of the nuclear decommissioning trust funds to the
Transferee Company in a contested case proceeding pursuant to subsection (d)(6)(E) of
this section at the time of submission of such agreements or anytime thereafter.
(B) In connection with the submission required in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the
Transferee Company shall submit an affidavit, signed under oath by an authorized officer
of the Transferee Company, certifying that once the transfer of administration of the
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds is ordered by the commission, the transferred funds
and the future contributions to the funds will be administered in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section and that the company will not challenge the authority of the commission
to enforce its rules that shall be adopted from time to time relating to the collection,
investment and use of the funds provided by Collecting Utility customers for nuclear
decommissioning.
(2) For transfers of Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds that occurred before this rule took effect,
the executed decommissioning funds collection agreement(s) and agreements with the institutional
trustee and investment manager(s) shall be filed at the commission within 15 days of the effective
date of this rule, unless such agreements have previously been filed with the commission. If such
agreements must be amended to comply with this section, the amended agreements must take effect
on or before the Collecting Utility’s next general rate proceeding or a rate proceeding under
subsection (g) of this section, whichever occurs first.
(3) Prior to executing an amended decommissioning funds collection agreement or amended agreement
with the institutional trustee or investment managers, the proposed amended agreement shall be filed
at the commission for review along with a redlined version showing all changes made since the
document was reviewed by the commission, and copies shall be provided to the commission’s Legal
and Enforcement Division and Financial Review Division.
(4) A Transferee Company shall maintain one or more irrevocable trusts external to the Transferee
Company for the purpose of receiving the nuclear decommissioning revenues collected under costof-service rate regulation. The Transferee Company shall be named as beneficiary of each such trust.
If the Transferee Company has an existing trust for the same generating unit in which an interest is
being transferred that is funded by a set of ratepayers entirely distinct from that of the Collecting
Utility’s ratepayers, or funded by other sources, a separate trust or separate subaccount shall be
maintained that will segregate the decommissioning funds received from the Collecting Utility, and
any earnings thereon, from the nuclear decommissioning trust funds received from other sources.
There shall be no commingling of any decommissioning funds received from the Collecting Utility
with any other trust or subaccount containing nuclear decommissioning trust funds received from
any other set of ratepayers or other sources. If a single trust with subaccounts is utilized to hold the
decommissioning funds, the Transferee Company shall cause to be performed an independent audit
of all said subaccounts and shall otherwise act to recognize the interests of different sets of
ratepayers as may reasonably be requested by the commission.
(5) The Collecting Utility, the Transferor Company (if different from the Collecting Utility), and the
Transferee Company shall execute a decommissioning funds collection agreement. The agreement
shall provide that the Transferor Company’s rights to accumulated and future decommissioning
funds and the responsibilities for decommissioning of the nuclear plant shall be transferred to the
Transferee Company upon closing of the transaction. The decommissioning funds collection 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
agreement may provide for the remittance by the Collecting Utility of levelized periodic payments
based on the most recent annual decommissioning funding amount approved by the commission or
the actual amounts of nonbypassable decommissioning charges collected by the Collecting Utility
during each applicable remittance period, or for such other remittance arrangement as the
commission concludes is reasonable and consistent with the purposes of this section. In the selection
of a remittance arrangement, the parties to the decommissioning funds collection agreement shall
consider the impact on optimum tax efficiency pursuant to subsection (e)(3)(B)(iii).
(6) After the Collecting Utility, the Transferor Company (if different from the Collecting Utility), and
Transferee Company have filed a request for a commission review of the agreements filed pursuant
to subsection (d)(1)(A) or (d)(3) of this section:
(A) The commission staff will recommend approval, amendment, or disapproval of the
agreements within 60 days of receipt of the request.
(B) If the commission staff recommends approval, and no motions for intervention have been
filed, the commission shall promptly approve the request;
(C) If the commission staff recommends amendment, within 14 days after staff’s
recommendation the filing parties shall either file amended agreements incorporating the
amendments, request review of alternative language, or request a hearing.
(D) If the applicants file amended agreements incorporating the staff recommendations, and
there is no motion to intervene filed, the commission shall promptly approve the amended
request.
(E) If the commission staff recommends denial, if the applicants request a hearing, or if the
applicants do not file amended agreements incorporating staff’s recommendations within
14 days pursuant to subsection (d)(6)(C), the request shall be docketed as a contested case
proceeding to approve, modify, or reject the agreements. The commission will issue an
order within 120 days of the initiation of a contested case proceeding. In considering
whether or not to approve the decommissioning funds collection agreement, the
commission may consider the impact on customers including any impact on federal income
taxes related to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, the ability of the Transferee
Company to administer the trust, any investment restrictions on the Transferee Company,
the ability of the commission to enforce its rules over the administrator of the funds, and
any other relevant factors.
(F) An agreement filed pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(A) and (d)(3) of this section shall be filed
at the commission within 15 days of the execution of the agreement.
(7) Absent a commission order to the contrary, the Collecting Utility shall be the administrator of the
nuclear decommissioning trust funds established or maintained by the Transferee Company and
shall be responsible for administering the funds in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.
(8) Upon the issuance of an order from the commission releasing the Collecting Utility from the
obligation to administer the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, the Transferee Company that
owns the nuclear decommissioning trust funds shall become the administrator of such funds in
accordance with subsection (e) of this section.
(e) Administration of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds.
(1) Duties of funds administrator.
(A) Each funds administrator of Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds shall assure that the
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds are managed so that the funds are secure and are
invested consistent with the goals in this subsection; and so that the funds provided from
the Collecting Utility’s nonbypassable charge, plus the amounts earned from investment of
the funds, will be available at the time of decommissioning.
(B) The funds administrator shall appoint one or more institutional trustees and may appoint
one or more investment managers. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (2) of this
subsection, the Texas Trust Code controls the administration and management of the
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds, except that the appointed trustees need not be 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
qualified to exercise trust powers in Texas. If the Collecting Utility is the acting funds
administrator, the selection or replacement of such trustees and investment managers shall
be made in consultation with the Transferee Company. The agreements with such trustees
and investment managers shall require that any reports regarding the trust funds given to
the fund administrator shall also be given to the Transferee Company, if different from the
fund administrator.
(C) The funds administrator shall retain the right to replace the trustees with or without cause.
In appointing a trustee, the funds administrator shall have the following duties, which will
be of a continuing nature:
(i) A duty to determine whether the trustee’s fee schedule for administering the trust
is reasonable, when compared to other institutional trustees rendering similar
services, and meets the requirement of paragraph (3)(B)(i) of this subsection;
(ii) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past administration of trusts by
the trustee has been reasonable;
(iii) A duty to investigate and determine whether the financial stability and strength of
the trustee is adequate;
(iv) A duty to investigate and determine whether the trustee has complied with the
trust agreement and this section as it relates to trustees; and,
(v) A duty to investigate any other factors which may bear on whether the trustee is
suitable.
(D) The funds administrator shall retain the right to replace the investment managers with or
without cause. In appointing an investment manager, the funds administrator shall have
the following duties, which will be of a continuing nature:
(i) A duty to determine whether the investment manager’s fee schedule for
investment management services is reasonable, when compared to other such
managers, and meets the requirement of paragraph (3)(B)(i) of this subsection;
(ii) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past performance of the
investment manager in managing investments has been reasonable;
(iii) A duty to investigate and determine whether the financial stability and strength of
the investment manager is adequate for purposes of liability;
(iv) A duty to investigate and determine whether the investment manager has
complied with the investment management agreement and this section as it relates
to investments; and,
(v) A duty to investigate any other factors which may bear on whether the investment
manager is suitable.
(2) Agreements between the fund administrator and the institutional trustee or investment
manager.
(A) The fund administrator shall execute an agreement with each institutional trustee. The
agreement shall include the restrictions in subparagraphs (A)(i)-(v) of this paragraph and
may include additional restrictions on the trustee. A fund administrator shall not grant such
trustee powers that are greater than those provided to trustees under the Texas Trust Code
or that are inconsistent with the limitations of this section.
(i) The interest earned on the corpus of the trust becomes part of the trust corpus. A
trustee owes the same duties with regard to the interest earned on the corpus as
are owed with regard to the corpus of the trust.
(ii) A trustee shall have a continuing duty to review the trust portfolio for compliance
with investment guidelines and governing regulations.
(iii) A trustee shall not lend funds from the decommissioning trust to itself, its officers,
or its directors.
(iv) A trustee shall not invest or reinvest decommissioning trust funds in instruments
issued by the trustee, except for time deposits, demand deposits, or money market
accounts of the trustee. However, investments of a decommissioning trust may 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
include mutual funds that contain securities issued by the trustee if the securities
of the trustee constitute no more than five percent of the fair market value of the
assets of such mutual funds at the time of the investment.
(v) The agreement shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
(B) The fund administrator shall execute an agreement with each investment manager. (If the
trustee performs investment management functions, the contractual provisions governing
those functions must be included in either the trust agreement or a separate investment
management agreement.) The agreement shall include the restrictions set forth in
subparagraphs (B)(i)-(v) of this paragraph and may include additional restrictions on the
manager. A funds administrator shall not grant the manager powers that are greater than
those provided to trustees under the Texas Trust Code or that are inconsistent with the
limitations of this section.
(i) An investment manager shall, in investing and reinvesting the funds in the trust,
comply with paragraph (3) of this subsection.
(ii) The interest earned on the corpus of the trust becomes part of the trust corpus. An
investment manager owes the same duties with regard to the interest earned on
the corpus as are owed with regard to the corpus of the trust.
(iii) An investment manager shall have a continuing duty to review the trust portfolio
to determine the appropriateness of the investments.
(iv) An investment manager shall not invest funds from the decommissioning trust
with itself, its officers, or its directors.
(v) The agreement shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
(3) Trust investments.
(A) Investment portfolio goals. The Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds should be
invested consistent with the following goals. The funds administrator may apply additional
prudent investment goals to the funds so long as they are not inconsistent with the stated
goals of this subsection.
(i) The funds should be invested with a goal of earning a reasonable return
commensurate with the need to preserve the value of the assets of the trusts.
(ii) In keeping with prudent investment practices, the portfolio of securities held in
the decommissioning trust shall be diversified to the extent reasonably feasible
given the size of the trust.
(iii) Asset allocation and the acceptable risk level of the portfolio should take into
account market conditions, the time horizon remaining before the commencement
and completion of decommissioning, and the funding status of the trust. While
maintaining an acceptable risk level consistent with the goal in subparagraph
(A)(i) of this paragraph, the investment emphasis when the remaining life of the
liability, as defined in subparagraph (B)(vi)(IV) of this paragraph, exceeds five
years should be to maximize net long-term earnings. The investment emphasis in
the remaining investment period of the trust should be on current income and the
preservation of the fund’s assets.
(iv) In selecting investments, the impact of the investment on the portfolio’s volatility
and expected return net of fees, commissions, expenses, and taxes should be
considered.
(B) General requirements. The following requirements shall apply to all Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds. Where a Transferee Company has multiple Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds for a single generating unit, the restrictions contained in
this subsection apply to all such trusts in the aggregate for that generating unit. For
purposes of this section, a commingled fund is defined as a professionally managed
investment fund of fixed-income or equity securities established by an investment company 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission or a bank regulated by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.
(i) Fees limitation. The total trustee and investment manager fees paid on an annual
basis by the fund administrator from the trust for the entire portfolio including
commingled funds shall not exceed 0.7% of the entire portfolio’s average annual
balance.
(ii) Diversification. For the purpose of this subparagraph, a commingled or mutual
fund is not considered a security; rather, the diversification standard applies to all
securities, including the individual securities held in commingled or mutual funds.
Once the portfolio of securities (including commingled funds) held in the
decommissioning trust(s) contains securities with an aggregate value in excess of
$20 million, it shall be diversified such that:
(I) no more than 5.0% of the securities held may be issued by one entity,
with the exception of the federal government, its agencies and
instrumentalities, and;
(II) the portfolio shall contain at least 20 different issues of securities.
Municipal securities and real estate investments shall be diversified as to
geographic region.
(iii) Optimum tax efficiency. The fund administrator may invest the
decommissioning funds by means of tax exempt, “qualified” or “unqualified”
nuclear decommissioning trusts; however, the fund administrator shall, to the
extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Service, invest any taxable
decommissioning funds in “qualified” nuclear decommissioning trusts, in
accordance with the Internal Revenue Code §468A (or any successor thereto).
The fund administrator shall avoid, whenever possible, the investment of taxable
decommissioning funds in “unqualified” nuclear decommissioning trusts.
(iv) Derivatives. The use of derivative securities in the trust is limited to those whose
purpose is to enhance returns of the trust without a corresponding increase in risk
or to reduce risk of the portfolio. Derivatives may not be used to increase the
value of the portfolio by any amount greater than the value of the underlying
securities. Prohibited derivative securities include, but are not limited to,
mortgage strips; inverse floating rate securities; leveraged investments or
internally leveraged securities; residual and support tranches of Collateralized
Mortgage Obligations; tiered index bonds or other structured notes whose return
characteristics are tied to non-market events; uncovered call/put options; large
counter-party risk through over-the-counter options, forwards and swaps; and
instruments with similar high-risk characteristics.
(v) The use of leverage (borrowing) to purchase securities or the purchase of
securities on margin for the trust is prohibited.
(vi) Investment limits in equity securities. The following investment limits shall
apply to the percentage of the aggregate market value of all non-fixed income
investments relative to the total portfolio market value.
(I) Except as noted in subclause (II) of this clause, when the weighted
average remaining life of the liability exceeds five years, the equity cap
is 60%.
(II) When the weighted average remaining life of the liability ranges between
five years and two and a half years, the equity cap shall be 30%.
Additionally, during all years in which expenditures for
decommissioning the nuclear units occur, the equity cap shall also be
30%.
(III) When the weighted average remaining life of the liability is less than two
and a half years, the equity cap shall be 0%.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
(IV) For purposes of this subparagraph, the weighted average remaining life
in any given year is defined as the weighted average of years between
the given year and the years of each decommissioning outlay, where the
weights are based on each year’s expected decommissioning
expenditures divided by the amount of the remaining liability in that
year.
(V) Should the market value of non-fixed income investments, measured
monthly, exceed the appropriate cap due to market fluctuations, the fund
administrator shall, as soon as practicable, reduce the market value of the
non-fixed income investments below the cap. Such reductions may be
accomplished by investing all future contributions to the fund in debt
securities as is necessary to reduce the market value of the non-fixed
income investments below the cap, or if prudent, by the sale of equity
securities.
(vii) A decommissioning trust shall not invest in securities issued by the Transferee
Company or the Collecting Utility collecting the funds or any of their respective
affiliates; however, investments of a decommissioning trust may include
commingled funds that contain securities issued by the Transferee Company or
Collecting Utility if the securities of such company or utility constitute no more
than 5.0% of the fair market value of the assets of such commingled funds at the
time of the investment.
(C) Specific investment restrictions. The following restrictions shall apply to all
decommissioning trusts. Where a Transferee Company has multiple Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds for a single generating unit, the restrictions contained in
this subsection apply to all such trusts in the aggregate for that generating unit.
(i) Fixed-income investments. A decommissioning trust shall not invest trust funds
in corporate or municipal debt securities that have a bond rating below investment
grade (below “BBB-” by Standard and Poor’s Corporation or “Baa3” by Moody’s
Investor’s Service) at the time that the securities are purchased and shall
reexamine the appropriateness of continuing to hold a particular debt security if
the debt rating of the company in question falls below investment grade at some
time after the debt security has been purchased. Commingled funds may contain
some below-investment-grade bonds; however, the overall portfolio of debt
instruments shall have a quality level, measured quarterly, not below an “AA”
grade by Standard and Poor’s Corporation or “Aa2” by Moody’s Investor’s
Service. In calculating the quality of the overall portfolio, debt securities issued
by the federal government shall be considered as having an “AAA” rating.
(ii) Equity investments.
(I) At least 70% of the aggregate market value of the equity portfolio,
including the individual securities in commingled funds, shall have a
quality ranking from a major rating service, such as the earnings and
dividend ranking for common stock by Standard and Poor’s or the
quality rating of Ford Investor Services. Further, the overall portfolio of
ranked equities shall have a weighted average quality rating equivalent
to the composite rating of the Standard and Poor’s 500 index assuming
equal weighting of each ranked security in the index. If the quality
rating, measured quarterly, falls below the minimum quality standard,
the fund administrator shall as soon as practicable and prudent to do so,
increase the quality level of the equity portfolio to the required level.
(II) A decommissioning trust shall not invest in equity securities where the
issuer has a capitalization of less than $100 million.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
(iii) Commingled funds. The following guidelines shall apply to the investments
made through commingled funds. Examples of commingled funds appropriate
for investment by nuclear decommissioning trust funds include United States
equity-indexed funds, actively managed United States equity funds, balanced
funds, bond funds, real estate investment trusts, and international funds.
(I) The commingled funds should be selected consistent with the goals
specified in paragraph (1) and the requirements in paragraph (2) of this
subsection.
(II) In evaluating the appropriateness of a particular commingled fund, the
fund administrator has the following duties, which shall be of a
continuing nature:
(-a-) A duty to determine whether the fund manager’s fee schedule
for managing the fund is reasonable, when compared to fee
schedules of other such managers;
(-b-) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past
performance of the investment manager in managing the
commingled fund has been reasonable relative to prudent
investment and utility decommissioning trust practices and
standards; and
(-c-) A duty to investigate the reasonableness of the net after-tax
return and risk of the fund relative to similar funds, and the
appropriateness of the fund within the entire decommissioning
trust investment portfolio.
(III) The payment of load fees shall be avoided.
(IV) Commingled funds focused on specific market sectors or concentrated
in a few holdings shall be used only as necessary to balance the trust’s
overall investment portfolio mix.
(f) Periodic reviews of decommissioning costs and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds.
(1) Following a transfer of Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant assets, including the associated
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds, any remaining costs associated with nuclear
decommissioning obligations shall remain subject to cost-of-service regulation based on a periodic
review of such costs pursuant to subsections (f)(3) or (g)(4) of this section. The reasonable and
necessary nuclear decommissioning costs as periodically approved by the commission shall
continue to be included as a nonbypassable charge of the Collecting Utility associated with the Texas
jurisdictional nuclear plant asset. Subsection (g) of this section shall apply to such charges by a
Collecting Utility.
(2) The Transferee Company shall periodically perform, or cause to be performed, a study of the
decommissioning costs of each Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating unit it owns or in which it
leases an interest. A study or re-determination of the previous study shall be performed at least
every five years, starting from the date of the most recent decommissioning cost study for the plant
on file with the commission. The study or re-determination shall consider the most current and
reasonably available information on the cost of decommissioning. A copy of the study or redetermination along with an updated funding analysis shall be filed with the commission and copies
provided to the commission’s Financial Review Division and the Office of Public Utility Counsel.
The funding analysis shall be based on the most current information reasonably available for the
cost of decommissioning, an allowance for contingencies of 10% of the cost of decommissioning,
the balance of fundsin the decommissioning trusts, anticipated escalation rates, the anticipated aftertax return on the funds in the trust, and other relevant factors. The funding analysis shall be
accompanied by a description of the assumptions used in the analysis and shall calculate the required
annual funding amount necessary to ensure sufficient funds to decommission the nuclear generating
plant at the end of its useful life.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
(3) The commission, on its own motion or on the motion of the Legal and Enforcement Division, the
Office of Public Utility Counsel, or any affected person, may initiate a proceeding to review the
Transferee Company’s trust balances, compliance with this section, or the annual funding amount.
The Transferee Company shall provide any information required to conduct the review upon request
in accordance with the commission’s procedural rules.
(4) During each periodic review of decommissioning costs, the following evidence shall be provided:
(A) The Transferee Company shall file the periodic cost study described in paragraph (2) of
this subsection, along with an updated decommissioning funding analysis described in
paragraph (2) of this subsection, within 90 days of completion of the periodic cost study.
The cost study and funding analysis shall be accompanied by a report or testimony
supporting the analyses and the requested annual funding amount.
(B) The Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds administrator shall demonstrate that the
decommissioning funds are being invested prudently and in compliance with the
investment guidelines in subsection (e) of this section.
(C) To the extent the Transferee Company is subject to investment restrictions that are more
restrictive than the decommissioning investment guidelines in subsection (e) of this
section, the Transferee Company (or the funds administrator and the Transferee Company,
if different) shall demonstrate their efforts to obtain relief from such investment restrictions
in order to permit investments in accordance with the guidelines in subsection (e) of this
section.
(D) The Transferee Company (or the funds administrator and the Transferee Company, if
different) shall demonstrate efforts to achieve optimum tax efficiency as defined in
subsection (e)(3)(B)(iii) of this section, including, as applicable, maintenance of taxexempt status or efforts to achieve “qualified” status in accordance with Internal Revenue
Code §468A (or any successor thereto) with respect to its taxable nuclear decommissioning
trust funds.
(5) Within 90 days after completion of decommissioning the nuclear generating plant, the Transferee
Company shall file a request for a final reconciliation proceeding at the commission. Any funds
remaining in the trust after the completion of decommissioning shall be refunded to customers in a
manner determined by the commission. If the reasonable and necessary costs of decommissioning
exceed the amount available in the trust, the excess costs will be recovered through a nonbypassable
charge approved by the commission if the Transferee Company has substantially complied with this
section and prudently managed the decommissioning process.
(6) The Transferee Company shall file an annual report on May 15 of each year to report the status of
the decommissioning trust fund using a form approved by the commission.
(7) The Collecting Utility, as part of its annual earnings report, shall report the amounts and dates of
the deposits into the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds and, if different, the revenues received
from customers for the time intervals corresponding to each deposit.
(g) Collecting utility rate proceedings for decommissioning charges.
(1) A Collecting Utility that has decommissioning expenses embedded as part of a bundled rate shall
apply to have its current level of decommissioning funding removed from its general rates and stated
as a separate nonbypassable charge.
(A) In the case of a transfer of Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant assets to a nonaffiliated entity, the request shall be made no later than 30 days following the closing of
the transaction. The nonbypassable charge shall be based on the funding level and the rate
class allocation methodology as approved in the Collecting Utility’s last general rate
proceeding. Such proceeding to remove the decommissioning charge from the Collecting
Utility’s general rates and state it as a separate nonbypassable charge will not constitute a
general rate case. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 10/26/04
(B) In the case of a transfer of Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant assets to an
affiliated power-generating company, the request for a separate nonbypassable charge shall
be made during the first general rate case following the transfer.
(2) The Collecting Utility shall deposit the decommissioning revenues into the Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds consistent with the terms of the decommissioning funds collection
agreement on file with the commission and the most recent commission order authorizing
decommissioning collections from customers.
(A) The commission may on its own motion or on the motion of the Legal and Enforcement
Division, the Office of Public Utility Counsel or any other affected person, initiate a
proceeding to discontinue the deposit of decommissioning revenues to the Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds if the Transferee Company substantially or repeatedly fails
to comply with any provision of this section.
(B) If levelized deposits are made into the fund, the following provisions apply.
(i) The Collecting Utility shall keep records of its daily receipts from customers once
a separate nonbypassable charge is set by the commission.
(ii) Once the Collecting Utility has implemented a separate nonbypassable charge, it
shall request an adjustment in the nonbypassable charge if there is, and is
projected to continue to be, a material cumulative over- or under-collection of
revenues, including interest, greater than or equal to 15% of the most recent
annual nuclear decommissioning funding amount approved by the commission.
The request shall be based on the difference between the actual cumulative
decommissioning charge revenues collected from customers and the cumulative
amount authorized to be collected since the last rate adjustment, including interest
calculated in accordance with §25.236(e)(1) of this title (relating to Recovery of
Fuel Costs). The calculated over- or under-recovery amount will be applied to
the commission-authorized annual amount to determine the required
nonbypassable charge.
(C) If deposits to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are less frequent than weekly, an
implied interest calculation shall be used in setting the decommissioning charge to account
for the Collecting Utility’s short term use of the funds.
(3) Upon the issuance of a commission order under subsection (f)(3) or (g)(4) of this section in which
the commission determines that the annual funding amount required for nuclear decommissioning
for a particular plant has increased or decreased and should be adjusted, the Collecting Utility shall
file a rate application within 45 days solely to adjust the nonbypassable charge. The filing shall
provide sales data, a proposed allocation methodology, a proposed tariff, and any other information
necessary to implement the commission’s order. The commission will issue a final order within
120 days of receipt of the filing. Such rate proceeding will be conducted separately from the
Collecting Utility’s general rate proceedings.
(4) The Transferee Company may elect to request a change in the decommissioning funding level
during a general rate case of the Collecting Utility. The Collecting Utility shall give the Transferee
Company at least 90 days’ notice of an anticipated rate application for its general rates to allow the
Transferee Company to prepare a funding analysis to be filed jointly with the Collecting Utility’s
application.
(h) Good cause exception. Upon a showing of good cause, an applicant under this section may request that the
commission waive or grant an exception to any requirement of this section.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
§25.304. Nuclear Decommissioning Funding and Requirements for Power Generation Companies.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the terms for power generation companies (PGCs) that
are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for using a PGC decommissioning trust to satisfy the
financial assurance requirements for decommissioning a nuclear generating unit and to delineate the rights
and obligations of PGCs electing to use a commission-approved method for providing funds from Texas
customers for decommissioning a nuclear generating unit, as a means of complying with nuclear
decommissioning financial assurance requirements.
(1) A PGC is not required to use the methods set out in this section and may discontinue the use of the
methods set out in this section, if it chooses to satisfy the financial assurance requirements of the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission by using other methods acceptable to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
(2) A PGC decommissioning trust established in accordance with this section is separate from a Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust created under §25.303 of this title (relating to Nuclear Decommissioning
Following the Transfer of Texas Jurisdictional Nuclear Generating Plant Assets).
(b) Applicability. A PGC owning all or a portion of a qualifying nuclear generating unit may use a PGC
decommissioning trust as an external sinking fund in compliance with this section, provided that the use of
the methods of financial assurance set out in this section shall be available only to the first six nuclear
generating units the construction of which begins on or after January 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2033,
that elect to use a PGC decommissioning trust.
(c) Definitions.
(1) Decommissioning--includes the safe decommissioning and decontamination of a nuclear generating
unit, equipment, and materials consistent with federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements.
(2) PGC decommissioning trust--Funds that are contained in one or more external and irrevocable trusts
created for the purpose of protecting and holding revenue collected from a PGC to cover the costs
of decommissioning a Texas jurisdictional nuclear generating plant at the end of its useful life. A
PGC decommissioning trust is a type of external sinking fund that is established and maintained by
setting aside funds periodically in an account segregated from the PGC’s assets and outside the
PGC’s administrative control in which the total amount of funds would be sufficient to pay
decommissioning costs at the time termination of operations is expected.
(3) Retail electric customer--A retail electric customer in a geographic area of Texas in which retail
customer choice has been implemented, or a retail electric customer of a municipally-owned utility
or electric cooperative that has an agreement to purchase power from a nuclear generating unit.
(4) Under construction--A nuclear generating unit for which the PGC has initiated the pouring of safetyrelated concrete for the reactor building.
(d) Application. If a PGC elects to use a PGC decommissioning trust, the PGC shall submit an application to
the commission for an order establishing the amount of annual decommissioning funding and approving trust
agreements. A PGC may combine applications for more than one qualifying nuclear generating unit. An
application must contain the following information:
(1) Identification of each nuclear generating unit included in the application;
(2) Quantification of the PGC’s percentage of ownership of each unit;
(3) Decommissioning cost study using the most currently available information on the cost of
decommissioning each unit as set out in subsection (h)(2) of this section;
(4) Funding analysis identifying the expected amount of annual decommissioning funding determined
as set out in subsection (i) of this section;
(5) Description of the method to be used to satisfy the state assurance obligation set forth in subsection
(k) of this section, including any guarantee agreements, support agreements, credit agreements, or
letters of credit or surety bonds;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
(6) Agreements with an institutional trustee and investment manager to manage the PGC
decommissioning trust that are consistent with this section and the terms and conditions required by
the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and
(7) Projected date for beginning funding of the PGC decommissioning trust, which must be prior to the
commencement of initial fuel load and commercial operation of the nuclear generating unit.
(e) Commission Review.
(1) The commission staff will endeavor to recommend approval, amendment, or disapproval of an
application setting annual decommissioning funding and financial agreements to implement the trust
requirements within 120 days of receipt of a sufficient application, unless a hearing on the
application is required.
(2) A request for hearing shall be filed by the date specified by the presiding officer which shall be no
more than 60 days after the filing of the application. If a hearing is scheduled, the commission will
endeavor to issue a final order within 180 days after the filing of a request for hearing.
(3) If no hearing is requested, the commission staff concludes that the application setting annual
decommissioning funding and the trust agreements meet all requirements of this section, and the
commission staff recommends approval, the application may be approved administratively or
informally pursuant to §22.35 of this title (relating to Informal Disposition).
(4) If the commission staff recommends an amendment to the funding or trust agreements, within 14
days after filing of staff’s recommendation, the PGC shall either file an amended application
incorporating the staff’s proposed amendments or request a hearing.
(5) If no hearing is requested and the PGC files an amended application that meets all requirements of
this section and incorporates the staff recommendations, the application may be approved
administratively or informally pursuant to §22.35 of this title.
(6) If the commission staff recommends denial and the PGC requests a hearing, or if the PGC does not
file an amended application incorporating staff’s recommendations within 14 days, the request shall
be docketed as a contested case proceeding to approve, modify, or reject the application.
(f) Order. An order approving the application shall establish the amount of annual funding necessary to meet
the decommissioning obligations for the nuclear generating unit over the unit’s operating license period as
established by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission or over a shorter period of time at the election of
the PGC.
(g) Annual Reports. On or before May 1 of each year, each PGC for which the commission has approved a
funding amount and trust agreements under this section shall file an annual report for the prior year using a
form approved by the commission. The report shall provide the status of the PGC’s decommissioning trusts
and any changes in the administration of the trusts, an update of its ability to fund the PGC decommissioning
trust; and other information specified by the commission in the form.
(h) Periodic Commission Review. At least once every three years the PGC shall file a decommissioning cost
study and funding analysis or updates of previous studies using the most current information reasonably
available to the PGC.
(1) The commission shall review the studies submitted by a PGC and other currently available
information using the procedure provided in subsection (e) of this section.
(2) During the initial and each periodic review of decommissioning costs, the following information
shall be provided:
(A) The decommissioning cost study and funding analysis accompanied by a report and
testimony supporting the analysis and the requested annual funding amount. The funding
analysis shall be based on the most current information reasonably available concerning
the cost of decommissioning, an allowance for contingencies of not more than 10% of the
cost of decommissioning, the balance of funds in the decommissioning trusts, anticipated
escalation rates, the anticipated after-tax return on the funds in the trust, and other relevant 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
factors. In no event will the cost estimate for basic radiological decommissioning be less
than the minimum amount required by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The
funding analysis shall be accompanied by a description of the assumptions used in the
analysis and shall calculate the required annual funding amount necessary to ensure
sufficient funds to decommission the nuclear generating plant at the end of its useful life.
(B) A demonstration that the decommissioning funds are being or will be invested prudently
and in compliance with the investment guidelines in subsection (o) of this section.
(C) A demonstration of efforts to achieve optimum tax efficiency as defined in subsection
(o)(2)(C) of this section, including, as applicable, maintenance of tax-exempt status or
efforts to achieve “qualified” status in accordance with Internal Revenue Code §468A (or
any successor thereto) with respect to the PGC’s taxable PGC decommissioning trusts.
(D) Confirmation that the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission either has made, or will
make, a finding that there is reasonable assurance of the financial qualifications of the PGC,
as required by federal regulations.
(E) Compliance with the state funding assurance obligation set forth in subsection (k) of this
section.
(3) The commission shall ensure that the amount of annual decommissioning funding is consistent with
the most recent decommissioning cost study and funding analysis, and that the PGC
decommissioning trust is adequately funded. The PGC shall update its state assurance obligation to
reflect changes in the annual decommissioning funding amount.
(i) Annual Decommissioning Funding Amount. The amount of annual decommissioning funding for a PGC
decommissioning trust shall be an amount that, based on such factors as the balance of funds in the
decommissioning trust, anticipated escalation rates, and anticipated after-tax return on funds in the
decommissioning trust, will cover the cost of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit at the end of its
operating license period. The amount shall be calculated based on the most current reasonably available
information, consistent with the most recent decommissioning cost study, and divided by the remaining years
of the license or a shorter period of time at the election of the PGC. The decommissioning cost study and
funding analysis shall include the information required by subsection (h)(2)(A) of this section. The
commission, on its own motion or on the motion of the commission staff, may initiate a proceeding to review
the PGC’s trust balances or the annual funding amount. The PGC shall provide any information required to
conduct the review in accordance with the commission’s procedural rules.
(j) Creditworthiness of PGC. For the purposes of the initial application under this section, creditworthiness of
the PGC will be established primarily through satisfying the State Assurance Obligation as provided for in
subsection (k) of this section.
(k) State Assurance Obligation. A PGC using a commission approved PGC decommissioning trust shall
provide additional financial assurances that funds will be available to satisfy 16 years of annual
decommissioning funding, based on the most recent annual decommissioning funding amount approved by
the commission (the state assurance obligation amount). If the remaining funding contribution period is less
than 16 years, the state assurance obligation will be based on the remaining number of years of annual
decommissioning funding. The state assurance obligation amount will be the discounted value of annual
decommissioning funding for the relevant period up to 16 years. Any arrangement for satisfying the state
assurance obligation shall permit the trustee of a decommissioning trust to demand payment by any company
holding funds or providing an assurance and require the company holding funds or providing an assurance
to remit funds to the trust, in accordance with this section. The PGC shall include in its annual report a
demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this subsection. The state assurance may be used to
provide assurance required by state or federal law for other similar purposes relating to the operation of the
facility, such as assurance for the funding to cover estimated operation costs, provided that adequate terms
are included to replenish the amounts available under the assurance mechanism if funds are withdrawn for 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
any such other purpose. The state assurance obligation may be accomplished by using one or more of the
following methods at the election of the PGC, in the form approved by the commission:
(1) A PGC may satisfy the state assurance obligation by depositing the required amount of funds into
an escrow account, a government fund, a nuclear decommissioning trust subject to the
commission’s investment standards set out in this title, or other type of acceptable agreement with
an entity whose operations are regulated and examined by a federal or State agency.
(2) A PGC may satisfy the state assurance obligation by obtaining a written guarantee or financial
support agreement from a direct or higher-tier parent corporation or a corporation with a substantial
business relationship with the PGC or by meeting the following standards itself. The guarantee or
financial support agreement must be payable to the PGC decommissioning trust. The parent or
supporting corporation, or PGC must meet one of the following standards:
(A) The parent or supporting corporation, or PGC must have:
(i) Tangible net worth of at least 10 times the state assurance amount, excluding the
net book value of the nuclear units subject to the state assurance obligation;
(ii) Tangible net worth of at least $500 million;
(iii) Net working capital of at least 10 times the annual decommissioning funding
amount; and
(iv) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90% of the total assets
or at least 10 times the state assurance amount.
(B) The parent or supporting corporation, or PGC must be otherwise financially qualified,
based upon a finding by the commission that there is reasonable assurance that the parent
or supporting corporation will be able to meet its obligations under the guarantee or other
agreement.
(3) A PGC may satisfy the state assurance obligation by providing an adequate surety, insurance, or
other guarantee method that meets the following minimum requirements:
(A) A guarantee that the state assurance obligation will be paid to the PGC decommissioning
trust upon any default by the PGC in satisfying its annual funding obligation.
(B) A surety method may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of credit. Any
surety method or insurance used to satisfy the state assurance obligation must contain the
following conditions:
(i) The surety method or insurance must be open-ended, or, if written for a specified
term, such as five years, must be renewed automatically, unless 90 days or more
prior to the renewal day the issuer notifies the commission and the PGC of its
intention not to renew. The surety or insurance must also provide that the full
face amount will be paid to the PGC decommissioning trust automatically prior
to the expiration without proof of forfeiture if the PGC fails to provide a
replacement acceptable to the commission within 30 days after receipt of
notification of cancellation.
(ii) The issuer must have a minimum rating of A- by Standard and Poor’s
Corporation, A3 by Moody’s Investor’s Service or the equivalent rating from
A.M. Best.
(iii) The surety or insurance must be payable to the PGC decommissioning trust.
(4) A PGC may satisfy the state assurance obligation using any other method acceptable to the
commission considering the relative risk factors and creditworthiness attributes of the applicant’s
financial characteristics to minimize exposure of retail electric customers to default by power
generation companies.
(5) A PGC shall notify the commission within 10 days of the date of any material change in its ability
to meet its state assurance obligation and provide a plan to cure any deficiency if the material
change results in a PGC’s inability to meet the state assurance obligation. Upon receipt of such
notice, the commission may initiate a formal proceeding to review the PGC’s ability to meet the
state assurance obligation, or take any other action it deems appropriate. The PGC shall provide 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
any information required to conduct the review in accordance with the commission’s procedural
rules.
(l) Annual Funding Obligation. A PGC using a PGC decommissioning trust shall remit annually to the fund
the most recent annual decommissioning funding amount required by the commission. A PGC shall make
periodic payments according to a schedule submitted to the commission and shall notify the trustee of the
decommissioning trust and the commission within 10 days of the date of any failure to make a scheduled
payment. The commission shall not consider a PGC to be in default of its annual funding obligation unless
it fails to remit the necessary amounts within 60 days of notice of potential default. If a PGC is in default of
its annual funding obligation, it shall notify the trustee of the decommissioning trust and the commission
within 10 days of the date of the default. If the PGC fails to cure its failure to make scheduled payment
within 60 days of the commission notice, the commission may direct the trustee to request that any entity
providing state assurance remit annually to the fund the most recent annual decommissioning funding amount
required by the commission in accordance with the schedule approved by the commission, including any
payments that the PGC has failed to make, until the PGC is not in default or until the assurance is depleted.
(m) Funding Shortfall and Unspent Funds.
(1) If the PGC fails to meet its annual funding requirements and if the state assurance obligations are
insufficient to meet the annual funding obligations or are otherwise not honored, the commission
shall determine the manner in which any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning a nuclear
generating unit shall be recovered from retail electric customers in the state. For retail electric
customers of a municipally-owned utility or an electric cooperative that has an agreement to
purchase power from a nuclear generating unit, the amount of the shortfall in the cost of
decommissioning the nuclear generating unit that the customers are responsible for is limited to a
portion of that shortfall that bears the same proportion to the total shortfall as the amount of electric
power generated by the nuclear generating unit and purchased by the municipally-owned utility or
electric cooperative bears to the total amount of power generated by the nuclear generating unit.
(2) Decommissioning funds that remain unspent after decommissioning of the nuclear generating unit
is complete shall be returned to the PGC and the retail electric customers based on the proportionate
amount, in real terms, that the PGC and retail electric customers paid into the fund.
(3) While the nuclear generating unit is operational, as a condition of operating the generating unit,
the PGC or any new owner shall repay the costs the electric customers incurred in a manner
determined by the commission. The PGC shall be responsible for accounting for the need for
repayment of any decommissioning shortfall amounts paid by customers and shall report such
amounts pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. The PGC shall submit a proposal to repay
shortfall amounts paid by customers pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. The commission
shall review this information using the procedure described in subsection (e) of this section.
(n) Administration of the PGC Decommissioning Trust Funds.
(1) The PGC shall assure that the PGC decommissioning trust is managed so that the funds are secure
and earn a reasonable return; and that the funds provided from the PGC’s operating revenues, plus
the amounts earned from investment of the funds, will be available at the time of decommissioning.
(2) The PGC shall appoint an institutional trustee and may appoint one or more investment managers.
Unless otherwise specified in this section, the Texas Trust Code controls the administration and
management of the PGC decommissioning trusts, except that the appointed trustees need not be
qualified to exercise trust powers in Texas.
(3) The PGC shall retain the right to replace the trustee with or without cause. In appointing a trustee,
the PGC shall have the following duties, which will be of a continuing nature:
(A) A duty to determine whether the trustee’s fee schedule for administering the trust is
reasonable, when compared to other institutional trustees rendering similar services, and
meets the requirement of this section;
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
(B) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past administration of trusts by the trustee
has been reasonable;
(C) A duty to investigate and determine whether the financial stability and strength of the trustee
is adequate;
(D) A duty to investigate and determine whether the trustee has complied with the trust
agreement and this section as it relates to trustees; and
(E) A duty to investigate any other factors that may bear on whether the trustee is suitable.
(4) The PGC shall retain the right to replace the investment manager with or without cause. In
appointing an investment manager, the PGC shall have the following duties, which will be of a
continuing nature:
(A) A duty to determine whether the investment manager’s fee schedule for investment
management services is reasonable, when compared to other such managers, and meets the
requirement of this section;
(B) A duty to investigate and determine whether the past performance of the investment
manager in managing investments has been reasonable;
(C) A duty to investigate and determine whether the financial stability and strength of the
investment manager is adequate for purposes of liability;
(D) A duty to investigate and determine whether the investment manager has complied with
the investment management agreement and this section as it relates to investments; and
(E) A duty to investigate any other factors which may bear on whether the investment manager
is suitable.
(5) The PGC shall execute an agreement with the institutional trustee. The agreement shall be
consistent with this section and may include additional restrictions on the trustee. A PGC shall not
grant the trustee powers that are greater than those provided to trustees under the Texas Trust Code
or that are inconsistent with the limitations of this section. The agreement shall include the
restrictions set forth in this section and may include additional restrictions on the trustee.
(A) The interest or other earnings of the trust become part of the trust corpus.
(B) A trustee owes the same duties with regard to the interest and other earnings of the trust as
are owed with regard to the corpus of the trust.
(C) A trustee shall have a continuing duty to review the trust portfolio for compliance with
investment guidelines and governing regulations.
(D) A trustee shall not lend funds from the PGC decommissioning trust to itself, its officers, or
its directors.
(E) A trustee shall not invest or reinvest PGC decommissioning trusts in instruments issued by
the trustee, except for time deposits, demand deposits, or money market accounts of the
trustee. However, investments of a PGC decommissioning trust may include mutual funds
that contain securities issued by the trustee if the securities of the trustee constitute no more
than 5% of the fair market value of the assets of such mutual funds at the time of the
investment.
(F) The agreement shall comply with all applicable requirements of the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
(6) The PGC shall execute an agreement with the investment manager. If the trustee performs
investment management functions, the contractual provisions governing those functions must be
included in either the trust agreement or a separate investment management agreement. A PGC
shall not grant the manager powers that are greater than those provided to trustees under the Texas
Trust Code or that are inconsistent with the limitations of this section. The agreement shall include
the restrictions set forth in this section and may include additional restrictions on the manager.
(A) An investment manager shall, in investing and reinvesting the funds in the trust, comply
with this section.
(B) The interest and other earnings of the trust become part of the trust corpus.
(C) An investment manager owes the same duties with regard to the interest and other earnings
of the trust as are owed with regard to the corpus of the trust.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
(D) An investment manager shall have a continuing duty to review the trust portfolio to
determine the appropriateness of the investments.
(E) An investment manager shall not invest funds from the PGC decommissioning trust with
itself, its officers, or its directors.
(F) The agreement shall comply with all applicable requirements of the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
(7) Prior to executing an amended agreement with the institutional trustee or investment managers, the
proposed amended agreement shall be filed at the commission for review along with a redlined
version showing all changes made since the document was reviewed by the commission, and copies
shall be provided to the commission’s Legal Division and Rate Regulation Division or successor
divisions.
(8) A copy of the trust agreement, any investment management agreement, and any amendments shall
be filed with the commission within 30 days after the execution or modification of the agreement,
and copies shall be provided to appropriate commission staff and the Office of Public Utility
Counsel.
(o) Trust investments.
(1) The funds in a PGC decommissioning trust should be invested consistent with the following goals.
The PGC may apply additional prudent investment goals to the funds so long as they are not
inconsistent with the stated goals of this subsection.
(A) The funds should be invested with a goal of earning a reasonable return commensurate
with the need to preserve the value of the assets of the trusts.
(B) In keeping with prudent investment practices, the portfolio of securities held in the PGC
decommissioning trust shall be diversified to the extent reasonably feasible given the size
of the trust.
(C) Asset allocation and the acceptable risk level of the portfolio should take into account
market conditions, the time horizon remaining before the commencement and completion
of decommissioning, and the funding status of the trust. While maintaining an acceptable
risk level consistent with the goal in this section, the investment emphasis when the
remaining life of the liability exceeds five years should be to maximize net long-term
earnings. The investment emphasis in the remaining investment period of the trust should
be on current income and the preservation of the fund’s assets.
(D) In selecting investments, the impact of the investment on the portfolio’s volatility and
expected return net of fees, commissions, expenses and taxes should be considered.
(2) The following requirements shall apply to all PGC decommissioning trusts under this section.
Where a PGC has multiple trusts for a single generating unit, the restrictions contained in this
subsection apply to all trusts in the aggregate for that generating unit. For purposes of this section,
a commingled fund is defined as a professionally managed investment fund of fixed-income or
equity securities established by an investment company regulated by the Securities Exchange
Commission or a bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
(A) The total trustee and investment manager fees paid on an annual basis by the PGC for the
entire portfolio including commingled funds shall not exceed 0.7% of the entire portfolio’s
average annual balance.
(B) For the purpose of this subsection, a commingled or mutual fund is not considered a
security; rather, the diversification standard applies to all securities, including the
individual securities held in commingled or mutual funds. Once the portfolio of securities
(including commingled funds) held in the PGC decommissioning trusts contains securities
with an aggregate value in excess of $20 million, it shall be diversified such that:
(i) no more than 5.0% of the securities held may be issued by one entity, with the
exception of the federal government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and
(ii) the portfolio shall contain at least 20 different issues of securities. Municipal
securities and real estate investments shall be diversified as to geographic region.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
(C) The PGC may invest the decommissioning funds by means of qualified or unqualified PGC
decommissioning trusts; however, the PGC shall, to the extent permitted by the Internal
Revenue Service, invest its decommissioning funds in “qualified” PGC decommissioning
trusts, in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service Code §468A. The PGC shall avoid,
whenever possible, the investment of taxable decommissioning funds in “unqualified”
PGC decommissioning trusts.
(D) The use of derivative securities in the trust is limited to those whose purpose is to enhance
returns of the trust without a corresponding increase in risk or to reduce risk of the portfolio.
Derivatives may not be used to increase the value of the portfolio by any amount greater
than the value of the underlying securities. Prohibited derivative securities include, but are
not limited to, mortgage strips; inverse floating rate securities; leveraged investments or
internally leveraged securities; residual and support tranches of Collateralized Mortgage
Obligations; tiered index bonds or other structured notes whose return characteristics are
tied to non-market events; uncovered call/put options; large counter-party risk through
over-the-counter options, forwards and swaps; and instruments with similar high-risk
characteristics.
(E) The use of leverage (borrowing) to purchase securities or the purchase of securities on
margin for the trust is prohibited.
(F) The following investment limits shall apply to the percentage of the aggregate market value
of all non-fixed income investments relative to the total portfolio market value.
(i) Except as noted in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, when the weighted average
remaining life of the liability exceeds five years, the equity cap is 60%;
(ii) When the weighted average remaining life of the liability ranges between five
years and 2.5 years, the equity cap shall be 30%;
(iii) When the weighted average remaining life of the liability is less than 2.5 years,
the equity cap shall be 0%. Additionally, during all years in which expenditures
for decommissioning the nuclear units occur, the equity cap shall also be 0%;
(iv) For purposes of this subsection, the weighted average remaining life in any given
year is defined as the weighted average of years between the given year and the
years of each decommissioning outlay, where the weights are based on each year’s
expected decommissioning expenditures divided by the amount of the remaining
liability in that year; and
(v) Should the market value of non-fixed income investments, measured monthly,
exceed the appropriate cap due to market fluctuations, the PGC shall, as soon as
practicable, reduce the market value of the non-fixed income investments below
the cap. Such reductions may be accomplished by investing all future
contributions to the fund in debt securities as is necessary to reduce the market
value of the non-fixed income investments below the cap, or if prudent, by the
sale of equity securities.
(vi) A PGC decommissioning trust shall not invest in securities issued by the PGC
collecting the funds or any of its affiliates or any company providing security for
the state assurance obligation; however, investments of a PGC decommissioning
trust may include commingled funds that contain securities issued by the PGC if
the securities of the PGC constitute no more than 5.0% of the fair market value of
the assets of such commingled funds at the time of the investment.
(3) The following restrictions shall apply to all PGC decommissioning trusts. Where a PGC has
multiple trusts for a single generating unit, the restrictions contained in this subsection apply to all
trusts in the aggregate for that generating unit.
(A) A PGC decommissioning trust shall not invest trust funds in corporate or municipal debt
securities that have a bond rating below investment grade (below “BBB-” by Standard and
Poor’s Corporation or “Baa3” by Moody’s Investor’s Service) at the time that the securities
are purchased and shall reexamine the appropriateness of continuing to hold a particular 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter L. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Effective 1/09/14
debt security if the debt rating of the company in question falls below investment grade at
any time after the debt security has been purchased. Commingled funds may contain some
below investment grade bonds; however, the overall portfolio of debt instruments shall
have a quality level, measured quarterly, that is not below a “AA” grade by Standard and
Poor’s Corporation or “Aa2” by Moody’s Investor’s Service. In calculating the quality of
the overall portfolio, debt securities issued by the federal government shall be considered
as having a “AAA” rating.
(B) At least 70% of the aggregate market value of the equity portfolio, including the individual
securities in commingled funds, shall have a quality ranking from a major rating service
such as the earnings and dividend ranking for common stock by Standard and Poor’s or the
quality rating of Ford Investor Services. Further, the overall portfolio of ranked equities

with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.201.
(b) Application. This section shall apply to all utilities subject to PURA §39.201.
(c) Compliance and timing.
(1) All electric utilities must file a cost separation case under this section on or before April 1, 2000
according to a unbundled cost of service rate filing package (UCOS-RFP) approved by the
commission. Each electric utility shall, in its cost separation filing, file proposed tariffs for its
proposed transmission and distribution utility. The filings shall include supporting cost data for the
determination of the utility’s non-bypassable delivery charges, which shall be the sum of
transmission charges, distribution charges, metering system service charges, billing system service
charges, customer service system charges (if any), municipal franchise charges, nuclear
decommissioning charges (if any), and a competition transition charge (if any).
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an electric utility not subject to this section
until the expiration of the exemption set forth in PURA §39.102(c), must file its cost separation
case on or before 170 days prior to the expiration of the exemption.
(d) Test year. A historic test year shall be used to determine a forecast test year, defined as follows:
(1) Historic year -- for utilities filing a cost separation case on or before April 1, 2000, the historic year
shall be the 12-month period ended September 30, 1999. For a utility filing a cost separation case
after April 1, 2000, the historic year shall be a 12-month period deemed reasonable by the
commission.
(2) Forecast year -- for utilities filing a cost separation case on or before April 1, 2000, the forecast
year shall be the projected 12-month period ended December 31, 2002. For a utility filing a cost
separation case after April 1, 2000, the forecast year shall be a 12-month period deemed reasonable
by the commission.
(e) Rate of return. Each electric utility shall file a rate of return that is based on its weighted average cost of
capital as determined by one of the alternative methods indicated in the Unbundled Cost of Service Rate
Filing Package (UCOS-RFP) approved by the commission.
(f) Separation of affiliate costs and functional cost separation.
(1) Affiliate costs.
(A) Separation of affiliate costs. The affiliate schedules accompanying the UCOS-RFP shall
provide sufficient detail to enable the commission to evaluate the necessity and
reasonableness of the affiliate expenses and the “no higher than” cost provisions of PURA
§36.058 (relating to Consideration of Payment to Affiliate); §25.272 of this title (relating
to Code of Conduct for Electric Utilities and Their Affiliates); and §25.273 of this title
(relating to Contracts Between Electric Utilities and Their Affiliates). The schedules shall
provide the net total amount of affiliate expense requested for each of the historic and
forecast years. This information shall be provided by class of items for all affiliate
transactions between the transmission and distribution utility and its affiliates including the
affiliated power generation company and the affiliated retail electric provider.
(B) Affiliated service company. If there is an affiliated service company providing support
to the regulated transmission and distribution utility and the other affiliates, then the
UCOS-RFP shall include the transactions between the service company, the regulated
transmission and distribution utility, the power generation company, the retail electric
provider, and all the other affiliates pursuant to PURA §14.154. The UCOS-RFP shall
include detailed information on allocation formulas as defined by the reporting schedules.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 1. UNBUNDLING
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(C) Compliance with affiliate rules. The affiliate transactions reported in the UCOS-RFP
shall comply with the code of conduct rules as promulgated in §§25.84 of this title (relating
to Annual Reporting of Affiliate Transactions for Electric Utilities), 25.272 of this title,
and 25.273 of this title.
(2) Functional cost separation. All electric utilities shall separate their costs into nine categories,
relating to the following functions, as defined by §25.341 of this title (relating to Definitions):
(A) generation;
(B) transmission;
(C) distribution;
(D) transmission and distribution utility metering system services;
(E) transmission and distribution utility billing system services;
(F) additional retail billing services;
(G) transmission and distribution utility customer service;
(H) competitive energy service; and
(I) other unregulated services.
(3) Method of cost separation. Costs shall be assigned to the nine functions using the following threetier process. No common costs shall be assigned to regulated functions by default. If the utility
cannot meet its burden of proof, the costs in question shall be assigned to competitive functions.
(A) For each Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) account, costs shall be directly
assigned to functions to the extent possible, and all relevant workpapers provided.
(B) The utility shall provide detailed workpapers documenting the nature of any costs that
cannot be directly assigned. For adequately documented costs, the utility may derive an
account-specific functionalization factor based on the directly assigned costs or appropriate
cost causation principles. The utility must justify the assignment of common costs to
regulated functions, and must present evidence to support any such assignment.
(C) If adequately documented costs remain for which direct assignment or account-specific
functionalization cannot be identified, an appropriate functionalization factor as described
in the UCOS-RFP may be used. These functionalization factors should only be used as a
last resort. If a utility deems a functionalization factor other than the functionalization
factor prescribed in the UCOS-RFP to be necessary, the utility shall provide a detailed
justification for the chosen functionalization factor.
(g) Jurisdiction and Texas retail class allocation. Allocation of each of the functions comprising the
transmission and distribution system services revenue requirement to the existing rate classes shall be based
on forecasted 2002 test year load data. Costs related to other functions may be allocated based on a test year
ending September 30, 1999.
(1) Jurisdictional allocation. Functionalized total company costs for the forecast year shall be
allocated to the Texas retail jurisdiction. Jurisdictional allocators shall be based on either the
methodology approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), or the methodology
used in the last commission-approved cost of service study.
(2) Texas retail class allocation. Total Texas retail jurisdiction costs for each of the nine categories
shall be allocated among existing rate classes. Consolidation of classes shall be done only during
the rate design process.
(A) Transmission revenue requirement (system services). Electric Reliability Council of
Texas (ERCOT) utilities shall allocate the total transmission revenue requirement based on
the average of the four coincident peaks for each existing rate class at the time of ERCOT
peak, if that data is available. If that data is not available, the utility may use the average
of the four coincident peaks for each existing rate class at the time of the transmission and
distribution utility’s system peak. Non-ERCOT utilities shall allocate transmission
revenue requirement based on either the FERC-approved methodology or the methodology
approved in the last commission-approved cost of service study.
(B) Distribution revenue requirement (system services). Costs purely related to demand or
customers shall be allocated based on the methodology used in the last cost of service study 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 1. UNBUNDLING
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
unless otherwise determined by the commission. Other costs shall be allocated based on
allocators analogous to those used during the functionalization process, or appropriate costcausation principles.
(C) Generation costs. Total generation costs shall be allocated to the existing rate classes
based on the methodology used to allocate generation costs in the last cost of service study.
(D) Retail electric provider costs. Total costs of services which will be provided by the retail
electric provider as approved in the business separation plan shall be allocated among
classes based on the allocators used in the last cost of service study.
(E) Decommissioning costs. Costs associated with nuclear decommissioning obligations shall
be allocated based on the methodology used in the last cost of service study unless
otherwise approved by the commission. Total costs shall be reported in the unbundled cost
of service studies as a separate line item (or subaccount) in each account where such costs
occur.
(h) Determination of ERCOT and Non-ERCOT transmission costs.
(1) ERCOT transmission costs.
(A) The transmission cost of service for an electric utility in ERCOT shall be as described in
§25.192(b) of this title (relating to Transmission Service Rates).
(B) The UCOS-RFP adopted by the commission for the cost separation filings shall be used by
the electric utilities filing under this section.
(C) Any redirection of transmission depreciation expense to production by an electric utility in
ERCOT pursuant to PURA §39.256 should not affect the utility’s wholesale transmission
cost of service that is used for determining the ERCOT postage stamp rate.
(2) Non-ERCOT transmission costs. For an electric utility in Texas operating outside ERCOT, the
utility’s open access transmission tariff approved by FERC will be used to determine the utility’s
transmission cost and rates in Texas.
(i) Rate design. Utilities shall consolidate existing rate classes into the minimum number of classes needed to
recognize differences in usage of the transmission and distribution systems. Class consolidation shall not
materially disadvantage any customer class.

TNRCC in effect at the time of filing, so long as such facility serves the same end-user it was
serving on September 1, 2001.
(B) An on-site power production facility with a rated capacity of ten megawatts or less;
(C) Any generation facility that lawfully served a retail customer’s actual load which is capable of
lawfully delivering power to the site without use of utility distribution or transmission facilities
and which is not new on-site generation including but not limited to facilities described in
subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, so long as the facility continues to serve the same
end-user or users it was serving on December 31, 1999 if it was fully operational at that time or
the end-user or users who first took power from the facility when it became operational if it
become operational after December 31, 1999.
(d) Right to recover stranded costs. An electric utility is allowed to recover all of its net, verifiable,
nonmitigable stranded costs incurred in purchasing power and providing electric generation service.
Recovery of retail stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers,
including the facilities, premises, and loads of those retail customers, within the utility’s geographical
certificated service area as it existed on May 1, 1999. A retail customer may not avoid stranded cost recovery
charges by switching to on-site generation except as provided by subsection (i) of this section. In multiply
certificated areas, a retail customer may not avoid stranded cost recovery charges by switching to another
electric utility, electric cooperative, or municipally owned utility after May 1, 1999.
(e) Recovery of stranded cost from wholesale customers. Nothing in this section shall alter the rights of
utilities to recover wholesale stranded costs from wholesale customers. If the utility decides not to recover
some or all stranded costs from its wholesale customers, it shall not recover these costs from retail customers
through non-bypassable charges or otherwise.
(f) Quantification of stranded costs. An electric utility seeking to recover its stranded costs shall submit the
necessary information in compliance with the unbundled cost of service rate filing package (UCOS-RFP)
approved by the commission. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 1. UNBUNDLING
Effective 2/09/00
(g) Recovery of stranded costs through securitization. An electric utility that seeks to recover regulatory
assets and stranded costs through securitization financing pursuant to PURA, Chapter 39, Subchapter G shall
request a separate competition transition charge for that purpose.
(1) An electric utility that seeks to securitize its regulatory assets or stranded costs pursuant to PURA
§39.201(i)(1) shall file an application using the commission-approved form.
(2) An electric utility may seek to securitize its regulatory assets under PURA §39.201(i) any time after
September 1, 1999.
(3) An electric utility that seeks to securitize its stranded costs under PURA §39.201(i) must obtain a
determination by the commission of its revised estimate of stranded costs prior to submitting its
application.
(4) The amount of regulatory assets eligible for securitization as determined by the commission in a
proceeding pursuant to §39.201(i)(1) shall be considered in the quantification of stranded costs in
subsection (f) of this section.
(h) Allocation of stranded costs. Allocation of stranded costs and calculation of CTC per customer class shall
be part of the cost separation proceedings as defined in §25.344 of this title (relating to Cost Separation
Proceedings). The utility shall submit information in accordance with the instructions contained in the
UCOS-RFP.
(1) Jurisdictional allocation. Costs shall be allocated to the Texas retail jurisdiction in accordance with
the jurisdictional allocation methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the
electric utility’s most recent commission order addressing rate design.
(2) Allocation among Texas customer classes. Stranded costs shall be allocated in the following
manner.
(A) Any capital costs incurred by an electric utility to improve air quality under PURA §39.263 or
§39.264 that are included in a utility’s invested capital in accordance with those sections shall
be allocated among customer classes as follows: 50% of those costs shall be allocated in
accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the electric
utility’s most recent commission order addressing rate design; and the remainder shall be
allocated on the basis of the energy consumption of the customer classes.
(B) All other retail stranded costs shall be allocated among retail customer classes in the following
manner:
(i) The allocation to the residential class shall be determined by allocating to all customer
classes 50% of the stranded costs in accordance with the methodology used to allocate
the costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility’s most recent commission order
addressing rate design and allocating the remainder of the stranded costs on the basis of
the energy consumption of the classes.
(ii) After the allocation to the residential class required by clause (i) of this subparagraph has
been calculated, the remaining stranded costs shall be allocated to the remaining
customer classes in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the
underlying assets in the electric utility’s most recent commission order addressing rate
design. Non-firm industrial customers shall be allocated stranded costs equal to 150%
of the amount allocated to that class.
(iii) After the allocation to the residential class required by clause (i) of this subparagraph
and the allocation to the nonfirm industrial class required by clause (ii) of this
subparagraph have been calculated, the remaining stranded costs shall be allocated to the
remaining customer classes in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the
costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility’s most recent commission order
addressing rate design.
(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to the extent that the total retail
stranded costs, including regulatory assets, of investor-owned utilities exceed $5 billion
on a statewide basis, any stranded costs in excess of $5 billion shall be allocated among
retail customer classes in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 1. UNBUNDLING
Effective 2/09/00
the underlying assets in the electric utility’s most recent commission order addressing
rate design.
(v) The energy consumption of the customer classes used in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph and clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be based on the data for the test year
ending May 1, 1999 adjusted only for line losses and weather.
(vi) For the rate classes which were not treated as a separate class in the utility’s last cost of
service study, the generation portion of the base revenues shall be used to develop a
demand allocator. For the rate classes that have been determined as discounted rate
schedules by the commission, the base revenues used to determine the demand allocator
for these rate classes should include imputed revenue.
(i) Applicability of CTC to customers receiving power from new on-site generation or eligible generation.
A retail customer receiving power from new on-site generation or eligible generation to serve its internal
electrical requirements may not avoid payment of stranded costs except as provided in this subsection. A
customer’s responsibility for payment of stranded costs shall be determined as follows:
(1) No CTC. An end-user whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not
receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a transmission
and distribution utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges.
(2) CTC for eligible generation. A retail customer whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible
generation who also receives electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities
of a transmission and distribution utility shall be responsible for payment of stranded cost charges
based solely on the services that are actually provided by the transmission and distribution utility, if
any, to the customer after the eligible generation facility became fully operational, such as delivery of
supplemental, standby, or backup service. Such charges may not include any costs associated with
the service that the customer was receiving from the electric utility or its affiliated transmission and
distribution utility under their tariffs before the operation of the eligible generation. A customer who
changes the type of service received from the electric utility or its affiliated transmission and
distribution utility after the customer commences taking energy from eligible generation will pay
stranded cost charges associated with the service it is actually receiving from the transmission and
distribution utility.
(3) CTC for new on-site generation. A retail customer who commences taking power from new on-site
generation that represents a material reduction in the customer’s use of energy delivered through the
utility’s facilities shall be responsible for payment of stranded cost charges that are calculated by
multiplying the output of the new on-site generation utilized to meet the internal electrical
requirements of the customer each month by the sum of the applicable stranded cost charges in effect
for that month. The applicable CTC for such customer shall be the CTC associated with the service
that the customer was receiving from the electric utility prior to switching to new on-site generation.
These stranded cost charges shall be paid in addition to the stranded cost charges applicable to energy
actually delivered to the customer through the transmission and distribution utility’s facilities. A
customer who commences taking power from new on-site generation that does not represent a material
reduction in the customer’s use of energy delivered through the transmission and distribution utility’s
facilities shall pay the CTC calculated as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection for that portion
of the customer’s load served by the new on-site generation.
(4) Material reduction. For purposes of this subsection, a material reduction shall be a reduction of
12.5% or more of the retail customer’s use of energy delivered through the utility’s transmission and
distribution facilities. The reduction shall be calculated by comparing the customer’s monthly use of
energy attributable to new on-site generation to the customer’s average monthly use of energy
delivered through the utility’s facilities for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on
which the customer commenced taking energy from the new on-site generation.
(5) Multiple on-site power production facilities. A retail customer may designate any number of onsite power production facilities located on a single site as eligible generation under subsection
(c)(2)(B) of this section as long as the sum of rated capacities of such facilities does not exceed ten
megawatts. Stranded cost charges for any on-site power production facility with a rated capacity of 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 1. UNBUNDLING
Effective 2/09/00
ten megawatts or less, not designated as eligible generation under this paragraph, shall be calculated
in accordance with the methodology set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection for new-on-site
generation that results in a material reduction in the retail customer’s use of energy delivered through
the utility’s transmission and distribution facilities. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of multiple on-site power production facilities under this paragraph has caused a material
reduction in the customer’s use of energy under paragraph (4) of this subsection, all of the energy
delivered to the customer from such facilities will be taken into account. A customer may not create
separate entities on a single site for the purpose of gaining exemptions under this paragraph. A retail
customer may change the designation of such an on-site power production facility:
(A) No sooner than one year after the facility’s initial designation;
(B) No sooner than one year after the facility’s subsequent designation; or
(C) Upon addition or retirement of any such on-site power production facility being used to serve
the customer’s load.
(6) Reporting requirements. Persons owning or operating new on-site generation or eligible on-site
generation shall submit the information required by §25.105 of this title (relating to Registration and
Reporting by Power Marketers, Exempt Wholesale Generators, and Qualifying Facilities). Those
persons shall also comply with procedures and reporting requirements described in the transmission
and distribution utility’s tariffs related to the assignment and collection of the CTC from eligible and
new on-site generation and any other commission rule or regulation related to the implementation of
this section.
(7) Adjustment to overall CTC. On and after January 1, 2005, the commission will periodically review
the overall allocation of the CTC among customers and/or customer classes to incorporate the loss of

range for the amount of the fee under this section is not a contested case for purposes of Chapter 2001 of
the Texas Government Code.
(e) Commission review and action. The ERCOT annual budget and any change in the system administration
fee are subject to review by the commission either annually or biennially, at the commission’s discretion.
Prior to the submission of a proposed budget or change in the system administration fee to the governing
board for its approval, ERCOT shall consult with commission staff designated by the executive director in
connection with the development of the budget and shall provide to the staff information concerning budget
strategies, staffing requirements, categories of expenses, capital outlays, exceptional expenses and capital
items, and proposals to incur additional debt. ERCOT shall file with the commission its board-approved
budget, budget strategies, and staffing needs, with a justification for all expenses, capital outlays, additional
debt, and staffing requirements. The commission may approve, disapprove, or modify any item included in
the proposed budget and budget strategies. After approving ERCOT’s budget, the commission shall
authorize ERCOT to charge a system administration fee, within a range determined by the commission, that
is reasonable and competitively neutral to fund ERCOT’s budget. ERCOT shall closely match actual
revenues generated by the system administration fee and other sources of revenue with revenue necessary to
fund the budget, taking into account the effect of a fee change on market participants and consumers, to
ensure that the budget year does not end with a surplus or insufficient funds. Any change to the fee approved
by the commission or made during the course of an annual or biennial budget cycle will be noticed through
standard market processes at least 45 days before implementation. ERCOT shall file with the commission,
upon request, a report comparing actual expenditures with budgeted expenditures. Such reports shall be filed
at least once per year.
(f) Performance measures. ERCOT shall develop proposed performance measures to track its operations.
Such measures shall be submitted for commission review and approval at the time ERCOT submits its
proposed budget. ERCOT shall provide an explanation for any performance measure whose value for any
of the preceding three calendar years was not within 5% of the commission-approved target. The commission
will review ERCOT’s performance as part of the budget review process. The commission shall prepare a
report evaluating ERCOT’s performance at the time the commission approves ERCOT’s budget and shall

DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
§25.381. Capacity Auctions.
(a) Applicability. This section applies to all affiliated power generation companies (PGCs) as defined in this
section in Texas. This section does not apply to electric utilities subject to the Public Utility Regulatory Act
(PURA) §39.102(c) until the end of the utility’s rate freeze. It is recognized that certain commission orders
issued during 2001 have effectively delayed competition in the service territories of Southwestern Electric
Power Company (SWEPCO) and Entergy Gulf States, Inc. (EGSI). This section shall apply to auctions
conducted after 2001 by SWEPCO and/or EGSI only when competition is implemented in their respective
service territories.
(b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote competitiveness in the wholesale market through
increased availability of generation and increased liquidity by requiring electric utilities and their affiliated
PGCs to sell at auction entitlements to at least 15% of the affiliated PGC’s Texas jurisdictional installed
generation capacity, describing the form of products required to be auctioned, prescribing the auction process,
and prescribing a true-up procedure, in accordance with PURA §39.262(d)(2).
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings,
unless the context indicates otherwise:
(1) Affiliated power generation company (PGC) — Any affiliated power generation company that is
unbundled from the electric utility in accordance with PURA §39.051.

an entitlement is sold.
(3) Auction start date — The date on which an auction begins.
(4) Business day — Any day on which the affiliated PGC’s corporate offices are open for business and
that is not a banking holiday.
(5) Capacity auction product — One of the following: “baseload”, “gas-intermediate”, “gas-cyclic”,
or “gas-peaking”. Each capacity auction product is further described in subsections (f) and (g) of
this section.
(6) Close of business — 5:00 p.m., central prevailing time.
(7) Congestion zone — An area of the transmission network that is bounded by commercially
significant transmission constraints or otherwise identified as a zone that is subject to transmission
constraints, as defined by an independent organization.
(8) Credit rating — A credit rating on an entity’s senior unsecured debt, the entity’s corporate credit
rating, or the entity’s issuer rating.
(9) Daily gas price — The index posting for the date of flow in the Financial Times energy publication
“Gas Daily” under the heading “Daily Price Survey” for East-Houston-Katy, Houston Ship Channel.
For EGSI gas entitlements in the eastern congestion zone, the daily gas price will utilize the “Gas
Daily” index posting for Henry Hub. For EGSI gas entitlements in the western congestion zone, the
daily gas price will be an average of the “Gas Daily” index posting for East-Houston-Katy, Houston
Ship Channel.
(10) Day-ahead — The day preceding the operating day.
(11) Entitlement or capacity entitlement — The right to purchase and receive, under the applicable
capacity auction master agreement, a block of 25 megawatts (MW) of electrical capacity and energy
from the assigned units for a specific capacity auction product for one calendar month.
(12) Forced outage — An unplanned component failure or other condition that requires the unit be
removed from service before the end of the next weekend.

controlling the facility; and
(C) Generating facilities that will be connected with a transmission or distribution system and
operating within 12 months.
(15) Master Agreement or Agreement — The applicable Capacity Auction EEI/NEMA Master Power
Purchase & Sale Agreement.
(16) Starts — Direction by the holder of an entitlement to dispatch a previously idle entitlement.
(17) Texas jurisdictional installed generation capacity — The amount of an affiliated PGC’s installed
generation capacity properly allocable to the Texas jurisdiction. Such allocation shall be calculated
pursuant to an existing commission-approved allocation study, or other such commission-approved
methodology, and may be adjusted as approved by the commission to reflect the effects of
divestiture or the installation of new generation facilities.
(d) General requirements. Subject to the qualifications for auction entitlements and the auction process
described in subsections (e) and (h) of this section, each affiliated PGC subject to this section shall sell at
auction capacity entitlements equal to at least 15% of the affiliated PGC’s Texas jurisdictional installed
generation capacity. Divestiture of a portion of an affiliated PGC’s Texas jurisdictional installed generation
capacity will be counted toward satisfaction of the affiliated PGC’s capacity auction requirement only if the
divestiture is made pursuant to a commission order in a business combination proceeding pursuant to PURA
§14.101, and after the transfer of the assets and operations to a third party.
(e) Product types and characteristics.
(1) Available entitlements and amounts. The following products, defined separately in subsection (f)
of this section for Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) and in subsection (g) of this
section for non-ERCOT areas, shall be auctioned as capacity entitlements under subsection (d) of
this section. Upon showing of good cause by the affiliated PGC and approval by the commission,
an affiliated PGC may propose to auction entitlements different from those described in this section,
including unit-specific capacity. Each affiliated PGC shall auction an amount of each applicable
product in proportion to the amount of Texas jurisdictional installed generating capacity on the
affiliated PGC’s system that are the respective type of generating units. An affiliated PGC that owns
generation in multiple congestion zones shall auction entitlements for delivery in each congestion
zone. The amount of each product auctioned in each zone shall be in proportion to the amount of
the respective type of generating units located in that zone, but the total shall not be less than 15%
of the affiliated PGC’s Texas jurisdictional installed generation capacity. The available entitlements
for the months of March, April, May, October, and November of each year may be reduced in
proportion to the average annual planned outage rate for the group of generating units associated
with each type of entitlement. Entitlements shall be for system capacity.
(2) Forced outages. For any given congestion zone:
(A) For all entitlements except those described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, if all
units providing capacity to an entitlement product experience a forced outage or an
emergency condition prevents or restricts the ability of an affiliated PGC to dispatch a
particular entitlement product, the entitlements of that product may be reduced in
proportion to the percentage reduction in capacity of the units assigned to that entitlement;
provided that such reductions in availability of any single entitlement do not exceed 2.0%
of the total monthly energy available from the entitlement.
(B) For entitlements that are supported by two or fewer generating units, if one or more of the
units providing capacity to an entitlement product experiences a forced outage or an
emergency condition that prevents or restricts the ability of an affiliated PGC to dispatch a
particular entitlement product, the entitlements of that product may be reduced in
proportion to the percentage reduction in capacity of the units assigned to that entitlement;
provided that such reductions in availability of any single entitlement do not exceed the
most recent three-year rolling average of the forced outage rate for the unit(s) supporting
the entitlement. The three-year rolling average of the forced outage rate applicable to 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
entitlements under this subparagraph shall be included in the notice of capacity available
for auction, under subsection (h)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of this section.
(C) Notification of any such reductions will take place as soon as possible, but in any event, at
least one hour prior to the hour-ahead scheduling period applicable to when the reduction
is to take place.
(3) Planned outage. The total MW reduction for planned outages is determined by calculating the
average MW of monthly planned outage for the generating plants associated with a product over the
previous three calendar years, multiplied by 12. The resulting planned outage hours are then
rounded down to the nearest whole entitlement (25 MW block). These “outage entitlements” can
then be removed from any of the five specified outage months (March, April, May, October, and
November) in any combination.
(4) Generation units offered. If an affiliated PGC changes the assignment of a power generation unit
to one of the four available product entitlements (baseload, gas-intermediate, gas-cyclic, or gaspeaking), then the affiliated PGC shall file with the commission the proposed changes in its
assignment of each of its power generation units to one of the four available product entitlements
and the resulting amount of each type of entitlement to be auctioned. As part of this filing, the
affiliated PGC shall provide planned outage histories for the years 1998, 1999, and 2000 for each
generating unit to be used to calculate the average annual planned outage rate for each group of
generating units. Interested parties shall have 30 days in which to provide comments on the
affiliated PGC’s proposed changed assignments. If no comments are received, the affiliated PGC’s
proposed assignment shall be deemed appropriate. If any party objects to the affiliated PGC’s
proposed assignments, then the commission shall determine the appropriate assignment considering
the manner in which the affiliated PGC expects to use such generation units.
(5) Obligations of affiliated PGC. The affiliated PGC shall dispatch entitlements only as directed by
the holder of the entitlement in accordance with the applicable product description. The affiliated
PGC may not refuse to dispatch the entitlement and may not curtail the dispatch of an entitlement
unless expressly authorized by this section or by the applicable Master Agreement, or unless directed
to do so by the independent organization in order to alleviate a system emergency. The affiliated
PGC shall specify in its notice provided pursuant to subsection (h)(2)(B) of this section the point on
the transmission system where energy from each entitlement is delivered to the entitlement holder.
(6) Entitlement holder receives no possessory interest or obligations.
(A) No possessory interest. The entitlements sold at auction shall include no possessory
interest in the unit or units from which the power is produced.
(B) No possessory obligations. The entitlements sold at auction shall include no obligation of
a possessory owner of an interest in the unit or units from which the power is produced.
(C) Scheduling. The entitlement holder shall have the right to designate the dispatch of the
entitlement, subject to other provisions of this subsection and the scheduling limitations
provided for in the applicable Agreement.
(7) Credit requirements.
(A) Standards. Entities submitting bids and all entitlement holders shall satisfy one of the
following credit standards:
(i) The entity holds an investment grade credit rating (BBB- or Baa3 from Standard
and Poor’s or Moody’s respectively or an equivalent);
(ii) The entity provides an escrowed deposit equal to the capacity price for the shorter
of the duration of the entitlement or three months plus the amount that would be

impact its compliance with the financial requirements it relied on in meeting the credit
standards in this section.
(G) In the event the holder or seller of the entitlement fails to meet or continue to meet its
security requirement, or an Event of Default results in the termination of the Agreement,
the entitlement shall revert to the affiliated PGC and shall be auctioned in the next auction
for which notice can be provided of the sale of the entitlement pursuant to subsection
(h)(2)(B) of this section.
(H) If an entitlement holder’s creditworthiness or financial security materially and adversely
changes after the auction is completed, as a result of an event specified in the Agreement,
the affiliated PGC shall provide the entitlement holder with written notice requesting
additional credit support or performance assurance in a commercially reasonable manner,
as set forth in the Agreement. The seller’s credit requirements shall clearly identify
objective criteria that would trigger a request for additional security and the methods and
time frame in which an entitlement holder must satisfy such a request. The affiliated PGC
may suspend delivery of any capacity or energy for which the affiliated PGC has not
already received payment until the performance assurance is received, in accordance with
the Agreement.
(I) If at any time after the auction is completed, there shall occur a downgrade event with
respect to the credit standing of the seller, then the entitlement holder may require the seller
to provide a credit assurance in an amount determined by the entitlement holder in a
commercially reasonable manner. In the event the seller fails to provide a commercially
reasonable performance assurance or guarantee within three business days of the receipt of
notice, then an event of default shall be deemed to have occurred, and the entitlement
holder will be entitled to suspend performance under the Agreement and withhold

schedule for energy from the entitlement no later than noon.
(III) The gas-peaking start deadline for declaring the daily capacity
commitment for each operating hour is two hours before the beginning
of the operating hour.
(iii) Schedule content. Each schedule shall specify, for each scheduling interval, the
energy scheduled to be delivered to the entitlement holder from the entitlement.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
(iv) Scheduling limits.
(I) The rate at which energy is scheduled by the entitlement holder in each
scheduling interval during one hour shall be either zero MW or 25 MW
and cannot change during the hour.
(II) Subject to the requirement of subclause (I) of this clause, if the
entitlement holder schedules any energy from the entitlement in one
hour, the rate at which energy is scheduled shall continue uninterrupted
at a level of 25 MW for not less than four hours.
(III) Subject to the requirements of subclause (I) and (II) of this clause, when
the entitlement holder decreases a schedule for energy to zero MW from
the entitlement in one hour, the energy scheduled shall continue
uninterrupted at a level of zero MW for not less than two hours.
(v) Default Schedule. If the entitlement holder does not submit a timely day-ahead
schedule then the schedule for the applicable operating day shall be deemed to be,
in every settlement interval of the applicable operating day, zero MW for the daily
capacity commitment and zero MW of energy. This deemed schedule may not be
changed in any revised day-ahead schedule, or in any hour-ahead schedule.
(F) Contract price for gas-peaking. The items to be included in the contract price between the
entitlement holder and the affiliated PGC for the entitlement shall include:
(i) Capacity payment. The capacity payment from the entitlement holder to the
affiliated PGC is the capacity price in dollars per MW specified in the letter
confirmation for the entitlement times 25 MW.
(ii) Energy payment.
(I) The energy payment for each settlement interval from the entitlement
holder to the affiliated PGC is the product of the fuel price defined in
subclause (II) of this clause times energy scheduled.
(II) Fuel price.
(-a-) The fuel price, for operating days for which the entitlement
holder designated its daily capacity commitment by 8:00 a.m.
in the day-ahead schedule, is the product of a heat rate equal to
14.100 MMBtu per MWh times the daily gas price.
(-b-) The fuel price, for operating days for which the entitlement
holder exercised its option to designate its daily capacity
commitment after 8:00 a.m. and before the gas-peaking start
deadline, is the product of a heat rate equal to 14.100 MMBtu
per MWh times (the sum of the daily gas price plus $ .25).
(G) Timing of payment of contract price. The entitlement holder shall pay the affiliated PGC
the capacity payment portion of the contract price not less than five days before the
beginning of the entitlement month or 20 days after receiving an invoice for the capacity
payment from the affiliated PGC, whichever is later. The entitlement holder shall pay the
remainder of the contract price after receiving an invoice for that amount in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement. If the affiliated PGC owes the entitlement holder any net
amount under the contract price calculation, it will pay that amount to the entitlement
holder in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
(6) Scheduling discrepancies. If the entitlement holder submits a schedule to seller for an entitlement
that violates any of the scheduling requirements for that capacity auction product type, the schedule
shall be deemed a non-conforming schedule for a scheduled hour. The schedule for that nonconforming scheduled hour shall then be deemed to be the same as the schedule for the nearest
preceding hour for which the schedule was not a non-conforming schedule. The seller shall
promptly notify the entitlement holder of a non-conforming schedule.
(7) Ancillary services. Until such time that all ancillary services issues are addressed and resolved
within the context of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved regional
transmission organization, entitlements will include rights only to energy and capacity as described 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
in this subsection and specifically exclude any ancillary services rights. Such exclusion is consistent
with subsection (e)(1) of this section, which allows products other than those described in this
subsection to be offered with good cause. In the interim, the affiliated PGC shall provide the
required ancillary services to eligible customers at the current FERC-approved rates.
(h) Auction process.
(1) Timing issues.
(A) Frequency of auctions.
(i) Auction dates. Capacity auctions shall begin on March 10, July 10, September
10, and November 10 of each year. If the date for an auction start falls on a
weekend or banking holiday, then that auction shall begin on the first business
day after the weekend or banking holiday.
(ii) Simultaneous auctions. Auctions for a product will be held simultaneously by all
affiliated PGCs of entitlements within the respective North American Electric
Reliability Council (NERC) regions in Texas. For example, ERCOT and nonERCOT auctions can be held at different times and dates.
(iii) Termination of the capacity auction process. The obligation of an affiliated PGC
to auction entitlements shall continue until the earlier of 60 months after the date
customer choice is introduced or the date the commission determines that 40% or
more of the electric power consumed by residential and small commercial
customers within the affiliated transmission and distribution utility’s certificated
service area before the onset of customer choice is provided by nonaffiliated retail
electric providers. The determination of the 40% threshold shall be as prescribed
by the commission’s rule relating to the price to beat.
(B) Auction conclusion.
(i) Receipt of bids. In order for an affiliated PGC that is auctioning capacity to
consider a bid, the bid must be received by that affiliated PGC by close of the
round for which the bid is to be submitted.
(ii) Concluding each individual auction. The affiliated PGC shall provide notice of
the winning bid(s) to auction participants and the commission by the close of
business on the first day after the auction closes that is not a weekend or banking
holiday.
(iii) Confidentiality and posting of bids. The affiliated PGC shall designate nonmarketing personnel to evaluate the bids, and persons reviewing the bids shall not
disclose the bids to any person engaged in marketing activities for the affiliated
PGC or use any competitively sensitive information received in the bidding
process. Upon announcement of the winning bids, the affiliated PGC shall
provide the commission and all auction participants information on the quantity
of each product requested by bidders during each round of an auction, but shall
not divulge the identity of any particular bidders. Upon specific request by the
commission, and under standard protective order procedures, the utility shall
provide the identity of the bidders to the commission.
(iv) The affiliated PGC shall be deemed to have met the 15% requirement if it offered
products in a product category (for example, gas-intermediate) and successfully
sold, at least, all of the entitlements offered in one particular month, in that product
category. If there is no month in which all of the products in a product category
are sold, the affiliated PGC shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (7)(C)
of this subsection.
(2) Auction administration.
(A) Each auction shall be administered by the affiliated PGC selling the entitlement. An
affiliated PGC or group of affiliated PGCs may retain the services of a qualified third-party
to perform the auction administration functions.
(B) Notice of capacity available for auction. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
(i) Method of notice. At least 60 days before each auction start date, each affiliated
PGC offering capacity entitlements at auction shall file with the commission
notice of the pending auction. Within 20 days of the filing of the notice, interested
parties may provide comments on the affiliated PGC’s proposed notice. If no
comments are received, the affiliated PGC’s proposed notice shall be deemed
appropriate. If any party objects to the affiliated PGC’s proposed notice, then the
commission shall administratively approve, reject, or approve the notice with
modifications. With respect to the September 10, 2003 auction:
(I) Affiliated PGC’s shall include a reference to Project Number 27826,
Rulemaking Proceeding to Require Another Set of Two-Year Strips
Under the Capacity Auction Rule, §25.381, in their 60-day notice with a
statement that the products to be auctioned in the September 2003
auction will not be fully known until after the commission finalizes
Project Number 27826; and
(II) Within five days after the rule amendment in Project Number 27826
becomes effective, affiliated PGC’s shall revise their notice, with
sufficient explanation, to accurately reflect the products to be auctioned.
(ii) Contents of notice.
(I) The auction notice shall include the auction start date, the date and time
by which bids must be received for the first round, and the types, quantity
(number of blocks), congestion zone, and term of each entitlement
available in that auction. The notice shall also include the following
range of bid increments for each product type to be used to adjust the
price of entitlements between rounds of the auction:
(-a-) Baseload - $ .05 to $ .75;
(-b-) Gas-intermediate - $ .02 to $ .30;
(-c-) Gas-cyclic - $ .02 to $ .30;
(-d-) Gas-peaking - $ .02 to $ .30.
(II) The affiliated PGC shall also specify which power generation units will
be used to meet the entitlement for each type of entitlement to be
auctioned. If baseload entitlements are being auctioned, the utility shall
also specify the fuel cost prescribed in subsections (f)(3)(B)(ii) and
(g)(2)(F)(ii) of this section at the time of the auction. If an entitlement
to be auctioned is subject to the forced outage provision in subsection
(e)(2)(B) of this section, then the notice must include the applicable
three-year rolling average of the forced outage rate.
(iii) The affiliated PGCs shall publish their respective notices and application forms
on their web sites no later than 45 calendar days before the start of each auction.
Each entity that intends to bid in an affiliated PGC’s auction shall complete the
forms, which include the first page of the cover sheet to the Agreement, and
submit them to the affiliated PGC at least 20 business days before the auction
starts, to allow enough time for evaluation and approval of credit. Potential
bidders may submit the required documents after that time, but at the risk of not
having credit and document approval in time for them to participate in the auction.
(iv) Credit approval for entities bidding on capacity auction products in ERCOT or in
non-ERCOT areas of Texas will be performed pursuant to subsection (e)(7) of
this section.
(v) The affiliated PGC shall notify an approved bidder of its available credit and send
the approved bidder a completed capacity auction-specific version of the
applicable Agreement, executed by the affiliated PGC, within ten business days
after the bidder has submitted the required information. The approved bidder
should attempt to execute and return the executed Agreement to the affiliated PGC
no later than five business days before the auction starts. The executed Agreement 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
shall be received by the affiliated PGC no later than two business days before the
auction starts. The affiliated PGC shall provide a password or passwords to the
approved bidder to allow access to the auction web site and to allow it to bid no
later than one business day before the auction starts. An approved bidder may not
request or receive additional credit after the auction starts.
(vi) Specific information on how to place bids and navigate the auction sites will be
provided by the affiliated PGCs to their qualified bidders prior to the beginning
of the capacity auction.
(3) Term of auctioned capacity.
(A) Initial auction. For the initial auction in September 2001, each entitlement was one month
in duration, with:
(i) Approximately 20% of the entitlements auctioned as two one-year strips with the
strips auctioned jointly (the 12 months of 2002 and 2003),
(ii) Approximately 30% of the entitlements as one-year strips (the 12 months of
2002), and
(iii) Approximately 20% of the entitlements as discrete months for each of the 12
months of 2002 (January through December of 2002)
(iv) Approximately 30% of the entitlements as discrete months for the first four
months of 2002 (January through April of 2002).
(v) Reductions in the amounts of entitlements available during the months of March,
April, May, October, and November of each calendar year shall be accounted for
in the entitlements offered as discrete months.
(B) Schedule of subsequent auctions.
(i) The auction in March of a year will auction approximately 30% of the entitlements
as the discrete months of May through August of that year.
(ii) The auction in July of a year will auction approximately 30% of the entitlements
as the discrete months of September through December of that year.
(iii) The auction in September of a year will auction:
(I) Approximately 50% of the entitlements as the one-year strips for the next
year; and
(II) Approximately 20% of the entitlements as discrete months for each of
the 12 calendar months of the next year.
(iv) The auction in November of a year will auction approximately 30% of the
entitlements as the discrete months of January through April of the next year.
(v) Reductions in the amounts of entitlements available during the months of March,
April, May, October, and November of each calendar year shall be accounted for
in the entitlements offered as discrete months.
(vi) The commission will periodically evaluate the need to sell one-year and two-year
strips and make appropriate adjustments to the terms of the auctions.
(C) Modification of term. If the auction is for a one-year or two-year strip term and the
affiliated retail electric provider (REP) expects to reach the 40% load loss threshold in
paragraph (1)(A)(iii) of this subsection, the affiliated PGC may request a shorter term strip
by providing evidence of the loss of customer load. Similarly, prior to an auction for the
next four available months, an affiliated PGC may request to not auction months in which
it projects reaching the 40% threshold. Such filings shall be made 90 days before the
auction start date. An affiliated PGC that will satisfy its auction requirements through
divestiture, as described in subsection (d) of this section may petition the commission to
set an appropriate term for entitlements. The affiliated PGC may not adjust the amount or
length of an entitlement to be auctioned except as authorized by the commission.
(4) Quantity to be auctioned.
(A) Block size and number of blocks. The block size of the auctioned capacity entitlement is
25 MW. The affiliated PGC shall divide the amount determined for each product 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
referenced in subsection (e)(1) of this section by 25 to determine the number of blocks of
each type to be auctioned.
(B) Divisibility. If the amount to be auctioned for an affiliated PGC for a particular product is
not evenly divisible by 25, any remainder shall be added to the product most highly valued
in the immediately preceding auction for products of the same duration and shall increase
by one the number of entitlements of that product.
(C) Total amount. The sum of the blocks of capacity auctioned shall total no less than 15% of
the affiliated PGC’s Texas jurisdictional installed generation capacity.
(5) Bidders. For each auction, potential bidders shall pre-qualify by demonstrating compliance with
the credit requirements in subsection (e)(7) of this section in advance of submission of a bid.
(6) Bidding procedures. For purposes of this section, the term “set of entitlements” shall refer to all
of a seller’s products of the same type and period. For example, a quantity of baseload products
sold as a one-year strip for 2002 would be a set of baseload-annual 2002 entitlements, while a
quantity of baseload products sold as the discrete month of July 2002 would be a set of baseloadJuly 2002 entitlements.
(A) Method of auction for affiliated PGCs within ERCOT. Each auction shall be a
simultaneous, multiple round, auction that includes procedures that allow switching by
bidders between affiliated PGCs and product types.
(i) Auction duration. Once a product auction commences it will continue through
each business day until that auction concludes.
(ii) Round duration. Each auction’s first round will begin promptly at 8:00 a.m. and
each round will last for 30 minutes with 30 minutes between rounds. For example,
the first round of bidding will start at 8:00 a.m. and end at 8:30 a.m., the second
round will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at 9:30 a.m., etc. No round may start later
than 4:00 p.m. All times are in central prevailing time.
(iii) Credit calculation. An entitlement bidder’s credit limit shall be adjusted during
the auction based on the value of the entitlements bid upon, and will be determined
by using an assumed fuel price stated by the entitlement seller, and the capacity
price for the lesser of three months or the duration of the entitlement plus the
amount that would be paid to exercise the entitlement for the lesser of three
months or the duration of the entitlement at the assumed dispatch for each product
as follows:
Product Peak Months
(May-Sept.)
Off-Peak Months
(Oct.-April)
Baseload 100% 90%
Gas-intermediate 50% 20%
Gas-cyclic 20% 10%
Gas-peaking 10% 2%
(B) Mechanism for auction for affiliated PGCs within ERCOT. Each affiliated PGC shall
conduct the auction over the Internet on a secure web page and shall assign a password and
bidder’s number to each entity that has satisfied the credit requirements in this section.
(C) Method of auction for affiliated PGCs in non-ERCOT areas. Each auction shall be a
simultaneous, multiple round, open bid auction.
(i) First round. For the first round of the auction, the affiliated PGC will post the
opening bid price determined in accordance with paragraph (7) of this subsection
for each set of entitlements available for purchase at the auction. Each bidder will
specify the number of entitlements it wishes to purchase of each set of
entitlements at the opening bid price(s). If the total demand for a set of
entitlements is less than the available quantity of the set of entitlements, the price
for each of the entitlements in the set will be the opening bid price and each bidder
in the round will receive all of the entitlements in the set they demanded. Any 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
remaining entitlements of the set will be held for future auction as noticed by the
affiliated PGC in accordance with its notice given pursuant to paragraph (7) of
this subsection.
(ii) Subsequent rounds. If the total demand for a set of entitlements in any round is
more than or equal to the available quantity, the affiliated PGC will adjust the
price upward within the range for each specific product type as noticed according
to paragraph (2)(B)(ii)(I) of this subsection. Bidders shall then submit bids for
the quantities they wish to purchase of each set of entitlements at the new price.
Subsequent rounds shall continue until demand is less than supply for each set of
entitlements. The auction then closes and the market clearing price for each set
of entitlements is set at the last price for which demand equaled or exceeded
supply. Bidders shall then be awarded the entitlements they demanded in the final
round, plus a pro-rata share of any entitlements they demanded in the next to last
round as described in clause (iii) of this paragraph.
(iii) Pro-rata entitlement allocation. The pro-rata allocation of entitlements will be
implemented by determining a bid differential between the next-to-last round bid
and the number of awarded entitlements based on the last round and awarding the
remaining entitlement to the bidder with the largest differential. The awarded
entitlement will then be subtracted from that bidder’s differential and the process
will iterate until all entitlements have been awarded. In the event that the
differential between two or more bidders is the same, the tie will be broken based
on the timestamp of each bidder’s last bid submitted in the next-to-last round. For
example, 14 baseload one-year strip entitlements are available and bidders A, B,
C, and D are bidding. In the last round, demand was only 11 entitlements and
bidder D did not bid.

For the last remaining entitlement there are three bidders that all have a differential of
one: “A”, “C”, and “D”. Therefore, a tie exists and the timestamp tiebreaker will be used
to determine which of the three bidders should receive the entitlement. Based on the
timestamps bidder “C” would receive the last entitlement, because it has the earliest time
stamp in the next-to-last round. The completed auction would appear as follows:

(iv) Auction duration. Once a product auction commences it will continue through
each business day until that auction concludes.
(v) Round duration. Each auction’s first round will begin promptly at 8:00 a.m. and
each round will last for 30 minutes with 30 minutes between rounds. For example,
the first round of bidding will start at 8:00 a.m. and end at 8:30 a.m., the second
round will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at 9:30 a.m., etc. No round may start later
than 4:00 p.m. All times are in central prevailing time.
(vi) Credit calculation. An entitlement holder’s credit limit shall be adjusted during
the auction based on the value of the entitlements awarded to the holder, which
will be determined by using an assumed fuel price stated by the entitlement seller,
and the capacity price for the lesser of three months or the duration of the
entitlement plus the amount that would be paid to exercise the entitlement for the
lesser of three months or the duration of the entitlement at the assumed dispatch
for each product as follows:
Product Peak Months
(May - Sept.)
Off-Peak Months
(Oct. - April)
Baseload 100% 90%
Gas-intermediate 50% 20%
Gas-cyclic 20% 10%
Gas-peaking 10% 2%
(D) Activity rules for affiliated PGCs in non-ERCOT areas.
(i) A bidder must bid in the first round for a particular entitlement to participate in
subsequent rounds.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
(ii) A bidder may not bid a greater quantity than it bid in a previous round for a
particular entitlement.
(E) Mechanism for auction for affiliated PGCs in non-ERCOT areas. Each affiliated PGC
shall conduct the auction over the Internet on a secure web page and shall assign a
password and bidder’s number to each entity that has satisfied the credit requirements in
this section.
(7) Establishment of opening bid price.
(A) If an affiliated PGC intends to change the minimum opening bid prices that would
otherwise be applicable under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, it shall file with the
commission, not less than 90 days before the auction start date on which the change is
proposed to be applicable, a methodology for determining an opening bid price for each
type of entitlement, if needed, based on the affiliated PGC’s expected variable cost of
operation, but excluding any return on equity. The opening price may not include any cost
included in the fuel price to be paid by entitlement holders, nor any cost being recovered
by its affiliated transmission and distribution utility through non-bypassable delivery
charges, but may recover variable costs not included in the fuel prices, such as fuel service
costs and start up fees. Parties shall have 30 days after filing to challenge the methodology.
If no challenges are received, the affiliated PGC’s proposed methodology shall be deemed
appropriate. If any party objects to the affiliated PGC’s proposed methodology, then the
commission shall determine the appropriate methodology.
(B) Minimum opening bids for entitlements shall be the same as the minimum opening bids
used in the most recent auction that included those entitlements, except that sellers with
plants that have been affected by congestion zone changes since the most recent auction
may use minimum opening bids that are different than the minimum opening bids in the
most recent auction, provided that the seller maintains the same weighted-average, by MW,
of the most recent auction’s minimum bids, for all of its plants of the same product type in
all congestion zones, to compute the new minimum opening bids for each product type.
Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent the commission from ordering a different
methodology for a seller, if the seller proves that good cause exists for the change.
(C) In the notice provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this subsection, the affiliated PGC
may make available an opening bid price calculated pursuant to the commission-approved
methodology for each type of entitlement to be offered for sale at auction. The affiliated
PGC shall not be obligated to accept any bid for a product less than the opening bid price,
but shall notify the commission that the opening bid price was not met. The affiliated PGC
shall be deemed to have met the 15% requirement if it offered products in a product
category (for example, gas-intermediate) and successfully sold, at least, all of the
entitlements offered in one particular month, in that product category. If there is an auction
where there is no month in which all of the entitlements of a particular product are sold,
then the affiliated PGC shall, in its notice pursuant to paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this subsection,
make a proposal to the commission in order to comply with the 15% requirement. The
affiliated PGC’s proposal may include revisions to the product category, product price, or
offer alternative products for auction.
(8) Results of the auction. The results of the auction shall be simultaneously announced to all bidders
by posting on the affiliated PGC’s auction web site with posting of the market clearing price for
each set of entitlements.
(i) Resale of entitlement.
(1) Compliance with provisions. An entitlement may be assigned, sold or transferred by the
entitlement holder only by following the provisions of this section. Any purported assignment, sale,
or transfer of an entitlement that does not follow the provisions of this section is void and ineffective
against the affiliated PGC.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter O. UNBUNDLING AND MARKET POWER
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
(2) Eligible entities. An entitlement holder may assign, sell, or transfer an entitlement to any person
or entity other than an affiliated REP, but the entitlement holder may dispatch the output of the
entitlement to an affiliated REP.
(3) Obligations. An entitlement that is assigned, sold, or transferred under this section remains subject
to the provisions of the Agreement under which it originated, and the assignee of that entitlement
succeeds to all of the rights and obligations of the assignor with respect to that entitlement.
(4) Liability. Neither the assignor nor any previous entitlement holder that has remained liable for
payments due to the affiliated PGC in connection with the entitlement as a result of a previous
assignment, sale, or transfer is released from liability to the affiliated PGC for payments due in
connection with the entitlement unless:
(A) At least 14 days before the effective date of the assignment, sale, or transfer, assignee has
provided security to the affiliated PGC that is equal to or greater than the security originally
given to the affiliated PGC for the entitlement; and
(B) At least ten days before the effective date of the assignment, sale, or transfer, the affiliated
PGC has notified both assignor and assignee in writing that the security has been approved
and accepted by the affiliated PGC.
(5) Requests to approve security. The affiliated PGC shall respond to written requests to approve
security to be offered by a prospective assignee within 14 days after receipt of that request. Approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) Effective date. No assignment, transfer, or sale of the entitlement by a party is binding on the nonassigning party until the non-assigning party receives written notice of the assignment, sale, or
transfer and a copy of the executed assignment, sale, or transfer document, and the assignment, sale,
or transfer is not effective unless such notice is received at least three days before the beginning of
the entitlement month.
(j) True-up process.
(1) Process. For 2002 and 2003,the affiliated PGC shall reconcile, and either credit or bill to the
transmission and distribution utility, any difference between the price of power obtained through
the capacity auctions under this section and the power cost projections that were employed for the
same time period in the ECOM model to estimate stranded costs for the affiliated PGC in the PURA
§39.201 proceeding.
(2) PGCs without stranded costs. An affiliated PGC that does not have stranded costs described by
PURA §39.254 is not required to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(3) Any order by the commission that finally resolves an affiliated PGC’s stranded costs, prior to trueup, supersedes this subsection.
(k) True-up process for electric utilities with divestiture. If an affiliated PGC meets its capacity auction
requirements through a divestiture as allowed by subsection (d) of this section, the proceeds of the divestiture
shall be used for purposes of the true-up calculation.
(l) Modification of auction procedures or products. Upon a finding by the commission that the auction
procedures or products require modification to better value the products or to better suit the needs of the
competitive market, the commission may, by order, modify the procedures or products detailed in this section.
(m) Contract terms.

DIVISION 3. CAPACITY AUCTION.
Effective 7/31/03
(3) Electronic scheduling. The Agreement shall require that, if the affiliated PGC provides an
electronic scheduling interface for the dispatch of entitlements, then the entitlement holder shall
schedule the dispatch of its entitlements using that electronic interface.
(4) Scheduling discrepancies. If an entitlement holder submits a non-conforming schedule to the
affiliated PGC for an entitlement that violates any of the scheduling requirements for that capacity
auction product type for a scheduled hour, then the schedule for that hour is deemed to be the same
as the schedule for the hour most closely preceding that scheduled hour that was not a nonconforming schedule. The affiliated PGC shall promptly notify the entitlement holder of a nonconforming schedule. However, the requirements of this paragraph are subject to the default
scheduling requirements for baseload and gas-intermediate products delineated in subsections
(f)(3)(A)(iv)(V) and (f)(4)(A)(v) of this section for ERCOT areas, and subsections (g)(2)(E)(v) and
(g)(3)(E)(v) of this section for non-ERCOT areas.
(5) Alternative dispute resolution. Alternative dispute resolution shall be a condition precedent to
any right of any legal action regarding a dispute arising under, or in connection with, the standard
agreement adopted by the commission. The parties may mutually agree to dispute resolution
procedures. If the parties are unable to agree upon such procedures within five days after such
dispute arises, the parties shall use the alternative dispute resolution procedures contained in the
ERCOT protocols.
(6) Seller’s failure to fulfill obligation. If an entitlement holder is assessed for imbalanced schedules,
failure to procure ancillary services, or any other charges from ERCOT due to the failure of the
affiliated PGC to fulfill the auctioned obligation, the affiliated PGC shall be responsible for these
costs incurred by the entitlement holder.

§25.401. Share of Installed Generation Capacity.
(a) Application. The provisions of this section apply to power generation companies.
(b) Share of installed generation capacity. The percentage share of installed generation capacity for a power
generation company will be determined by dividing the installed generation capacity owned and controlled
by the power generation company in, or capable of delivering electricity to, a power region by the total
installed generation capacity located in, or capable of delivering electricity to, the power region.
(c) Capacity ratings. For purposes of this section, generating unit capacity ratings shall be consistent with
§25.91(f) of this title (relating to Generating Capacity Reports). The commission may revise reported
capacity ratings if they are found to be incorrect.
(d) Installed generation capacity of a power generation company.
(1) In determining the percentage shares of installed generation capacity under the PURA §39.154, the
commission shall combine capacity owned and controlled by a power generation company and any
entity that is affiliated with that power generation company within the power region, reduced by the
installed generation capacity of those facilities that are made subject to capacity auctions under PURA
§39.153(a) and (d).
(2) In determining the percentage shares of installed generation capacity, the commission shall increase
the installed generation capacity owned and controlled by a power generation company by the
transmission import capability that is available for importing electricity during the summer peak
season into the power region from generating facilities that are owned by the power generation
company or an affiliate in another power region.
(3) In determining the percentage shares of installed generation capacity owned and controlled by a power
generation company under PURA §39.154 and §39.156, the commission shall, for purposes of
calculating the numerator, reduce the installed generation capacity owned and controlled by that power
generation company by the installed generation capacity of any “grandfathered facility” within an
ozone nonattainment area as of September 1, 1999, for which that power generation company has
commenced complying or made a binding commitment to comply with PURA §39.264. This
paragraph applies only to a power generation company that is affiliated with an electric utility that
owned and controlled more than 27% of the installed generation capacity in the power region on
January 1, 1999. The commission will consider a permit application to the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission (TNRCC) to be adequate evidence that the power generation company has
commenced complying or made a binding commitment to comply with PURA §39.264. However,
the commission will review the progress that has been made on achieving an approved an TNRCC
permit, when it reviews and updates market share percentages, and if adequate progress has not been
made, the commission may choose to include the grandfathered capacity in the numerator.
(e) Total installed generation. The total installed generation will consist of the installed generation capacity
that is located in, or capable of delivering electricity to, a power region.
(1) Installed generation capacity will include all potentially marketable electric generation capacity.
Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, installed generation capacity will include:
(A) generating facilities that are connected with a transmission or distribution system;
(B) generating facilities used to generate electricity for consumption by the person owning or
controlling the facility;
(C) generating facilities that will be connected with a transmission or distribution system and
operating within 12 months; and
(D) generating facilities that are located on the boundary between two power regions and are able to
deliver electricity directly into either power region, except that the capacity of such facility shall
be allocated between the power regions based on the share of its total electric energy that the
facility sold in each power region during the preceding year.

(2) Installed generation capacity will not include generating facilities that have a nameplate rating equal
to or less than 1 megawatt (MW).
(3) The amount of installed generation capacity that is capable of delivering electricity to a power region
will be determined by:
(A) the import transmission capacity during the summer peak period of the alternating current
transmission interconnections between the power region at issue and other power regions; and
(B) the import capacity during the summer peak period of the reliable direct current interconnections
between the power region at issue and other power regions.

Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
§25.431. Retail Competition Pilot Projects.
(a) Purpose. This section establishes the parameters under which an electric utility shall offer customer choice
for 5.0% of the load in its Texas service area beginning on June 1, 2001, through the implementation of retail
competition pilot projects. The commission may use these pilot projects to evaluate the ability of each power
region to implement full customer choice on January 1, 2002, including the operational readiness of support
systems. The pilot projects conducted under this section also will serve to encourage participation in a
competitive retail market and to inform customers about customer choice.
(b) Application.
(1) This section applies to an electric utility as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)
§31.002(6). An electric utility exempt from PURA Chapter 39 in accordance with PURA
§39.102(c) may conduct a customer choice pilot project consistent with the requirements of this
section upon expiration of its exemption. A pilot project commencing before the adoption of this
section may fulfill portions of the requirements of this section, as determined by the commission.
(2) Other entities, including retail electric providers (REPs) certified by the commission, and
aggregators, power generation companies, and power marketers registered with the commission
may participate in the pilot projects under the terms and conditions established by this section.
(c) Intent of pilot projects. Pilot projects conducted under this section are intended to implement customer
choice for all applicable customers in the same manner in which full customer choice will be offered starting
January 1, 2002, to the extent practicable. Unless determined otherwise through a subsequent commission
proceeding, or unless stated otherwise in this section, all pilot project participants who are not retail customers
shall abide by all applicable commission rules, including but not limited to, rules relating to customer
protection and transmission and distribution terms and conditions, and all rules of an independent
organization as defined in PURA §39.151.
(1) Utility’s obligation to serve. A utility shall continue to provide electric service in accordance with
PURA and the commission’s substantive rules to requesting customers in its certificated service
area who do not wish to take service from a REP.
(2) Indemnification. Market participants, including utilities, shall be held harmless for any damages
resulting from any non-willful system or process failures during the pilot project.
(3) Performance standards.
(A) Call center performance may be compromised by potential large increases of customer
inquiries generated because of the customer education program and pilot project activities.
For the period February 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001, as applicable to each utility,
(i) a reduction of five percentage points will be applied to the percentage of calls to
be answered in the allowable time; or
(ii) 5.0% of the calls with the longest wait time will be subtracted from the calculation
of average answer time.
(B) An affected utility shall track and report such performance during the pilot project in
accordance with applicable commission rules and orders. An affected utility does not
waive any rights to request an adjustment or waiver of performance standards directly
affected by the customer education program or pilot project.
(4) Effect of pre-existing service agreements or contracts.
(A) To the extent a customer is otherwise eligible to participate in a pilot project in accordance
with this section, a utility shall not challenge a customer’s right to participate:
(i) based upon a claimed failure to provide notice of cancellation in accordance with
the requirements of an existing service agreement, contract, or tariff; or
(ii) in the event that the customer’s service agreement or contract is beyond its
primary term.
(B) To the extent a customer is otherwise eligible to participate in a pilot project in accordance
with this section, customers in the primary term of a service agreement or contract shall
have the right to participate in the pilot project subject to a challenge by the utility based 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
upon a service agreement or contractual issue other than failure to provide notice of
cancellation in compliance with an existing service agreement, contract, or tariff. The
procedure for any such challenge shall be as follows:
(i) A utility contending that a customer that has been otherwise selected to participate
in the pilot project is not eligible to participate, because of an existing service
agreement or contract in its primary term, shall inform the customer not later than
seven days after the date scheduled for the lottery for the applicable class in the
event the class is oversubscribed or the date the customer requests participation
in the event the class is undersubscribed.
(ii) If the customer wishes to dispute the utility’s contention, the customer must,
within seven days of receipt of the utility’s notification, so inform the utility.
Pending resolution of the dispute, the utility shall reserve a place for that customer
on the participant list.
(iii) The customer shall be entitled to participate in the pilot project unless the utility
informs the commission of the pilot project eligibility dispute within seven days
of receipt of the customer’s notification to the utility disputing the claim of
ineligibility. Upon receipt by the commission of timely notice of the dispute, the
commission will resolve the dispute within 30 days after filing, and may do so
administratively.
(iv) If the commission determines that the customer is eligible to participate, the
customer will be included within the pilot project as soon as practicable after the
decision.
(5) Right to withdraw from pilot project. For any reason, and at a customer’s request, the REP and
the incumbent utility shall restore a residential customer’s account to pre-pilot project services and
rates. In the event a customer’s REP ceases to do business in Texas during the pilot project, the
incumbent utility shall restore any customer’s account to pre-pilot project services and rates at the
customer’s request.
(6) Application of renewable energy rule. To encourage access to energy generated from renewable
resources by customers participating in the pilot projects, the renewable energy mandate provisions
of §25.173 of this title (relating to Renewable Energy Credit Program) will be extended on a
voluntary basis during the pilot projects to the competitive portion of the market, with the following
changes:
(A) Each REP may acquire and retire renewable energy credits (RECs) consistent with its share
of retail kilowatt-hour sales during the pilot period (June 1, 2001 through December 31,
2001), at a rate consistent with REC obligations for the year 2002, and in the manner
specified in §25.173(h) of this title;
(B) Each REC retired for the pilot period will reduce the REC obligations of the REP for the
year 2002 compliance period;
(C) The voluntary settlement period for the pilot project renewable energy program will
commence January 1, 2002 and end March 31, 2002; and
(D) Penalty provisions of §25.173(o) of this title are not applicable.
(7) End of pilot projects. The pilot projects will end on December 31, 2001, unless determined
otherwise by the commission in accordance with subsection (j) of this section. For an electric utility
exempt from PURA Chapter 39 in accordance with PURA §39.102(c), the pilot project, if
undertaken, will begin and end on dates deemed reasonable by the commission. A customer will
remain with the REP by which he or she was served on the last day of the pilot project until the
customer or the REP elects otherwise. By participating in the pilot project, a customer does not
waive any right to take service under the price to beat in accordance with PURA §39.202.
(d) Definitions. The following terms when used in this section shall have the following meanings unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise:
(1) Aggregation -- includes the purchase of electricity from a retail electric provider, a municipally
owned utility, or an electric cooperative by an electricity customer for its own use in multiple

schedules) or have filed a manufacturing or processing tax exemption certificate
with the utility.
(D) Commercial and all other demand-metered -- all customers identified by an ESI who:
(i) do not purchase electricity under a utility’s residential rate schedule; and
(ii) do not come within the definition of the industrial demand metered customer
class; and
(iii) purchase electricity under a utility’s rate schedule that is based on a metered
demand.
(E) Other -- The other customer class is composed of all customers identified by an ESI who:
(i) purchase electricity under a utility’s rate schedule that is based on known usage
patterns, not actual metered data (i.e., unmetered loads); or
(ii) purchase electricity under a utility’s municipal or school rate schedules; or
(iii) purchase electricity under utility rate schedules applicable to seasonal agricultural
use, such as cotton gins, irrigation, or grain elevators.
(3) Electric service identifier (ESI) -- premise-based identifier assigned to each electric service
delivery point between a transmission and distribution utility and an end-use load, which is used in
the Texas customer registration system and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)
settlement system.
(4) Lottery -- fair process in which ESIs or aggregator packets of ESIs are selected for participation in
a pilot project by using standard statistical methods for simple random sampling; each ESI or
aggregator packet of ESIs should have an equal chance of actually being selected.
(5) Participation -- occurs when the customer takes service from a retail electric provider that is not
the incumbent, integrated utility.
(e) Requirements for participants that are not retail customers.
(1) A REP must be certified by the commission pursuant to §25.107 of this title (relating to Certification
of Retail Electric Providers) prior to participating in pilot projects established pursuant to this
section. An affiliated REP shall not participate in the certificated service area of the electric utility

register with that organization in order to become a wholesale buyer and seller of energy across the
transmission system.
(f) Customer education. Customer education for the pilot projects shall be conducted as part of the statewide
customer education campaign for introducing customer choice. Included in this campaign will be
announcements regarding the opportunity to participate in the pilot project and instructions on obtaining
further information about the pilot project. The commission shall mail information written in English and in
Spanish explaining the pilot project to eligible non-residential customers no later than March 1, 2001, and to
eligible residential customers no later than April 15, 2001. The utility shall provide the commission or its
designee with customer information necessary to implement this subsection. For purposes of this subsection,
§25.272(g)(1) of this title (relating to Code of Conduct for Electric Utilities and Their Affiliates) does not
apply with regard to proprietary customer information released to the commission or its designee. The
mailing may contain information including, but not limited to:
(1) a description of the pilot project;

website address for each REP, and a statement disclosing that the REP list is continually updated
and how the customer can obtain an updated list; and
(4) a clear, plain language description of customer choice and the price to beat.
(g) Customer choice during pilot projects. The following procedures shall be used for customers to participate
in the pilot projects within the designated time periods for each applicable customer class.
(1) Administration. For all customer classes, a REP shall submit requests to switch customers
participating in the pilot projects to the registration agent beginning on May 31, 2001, and power
delivery in conjunction with the pilot projects may begin on June 1, 2001. For purposes of this
section, any electronic submission to the utility shall be executed using a standard electronic data
interface (EDI) protocol (814) to be included in the utility’s compliance filing.
(A) Except where explicitly stated otherwise in this section, a REP shall electronically submit
switch requests to the utility for counting and validation purposes prior to submitting such
requests to the registration agent. The utility shall maintain a weekly updated list of nonmatching, rejected ESIs on its pilot project Internet website.
(B) Except for the industrial demand-metered class, there shall be no out-of-cycle meter
reading requests submitted for purposes of the pilot project before July 1, 2001.
(C) Members of the non-residential customer classes may elect to waive the verification and
recision process of the registration agent.
(D) A participating customer shall have the right to change from one REP to another REP in
accordance with the switching procedures adopted by the commission.
(E) Beginning April 16, 2001, a REP shall electronically report to the utility any switch request
for a customer or an aggregation packet with a listing of the ESIs to be switched to the REP
as set forth in this paragraph. After the utility confirms that a non-residential ESI or
aggregation packet is on the associated participant list, the utility shall submit the ESI to
the registration agent. The registration agent shall keep a record of all the ESIs identified
by the utility for participation in the pilot. The REP shall be responsible for submitting to
the registration agent the ESIs associated with the switch request to serve. If the ESI
identified by the REP matches an ESI identified by the utility, then the registration agent
shall allow the registration process to continue.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(F) Because the utility is assigned the responsibility to administer the pilot project, except for
complaints arising under §25.272 of this title, which may be made in accordance with
procedures established under that section, a claim by any party of unreasonableness
associated with the administration of the pilot project will first be addressed by the pilot
implementation working group established by subsection (j)(4) of this section. If the
complaint is not resolved within ten working days of initial notification to the pilot
implementation working group, the complaint may be filed with the commission.
(2) Residential customer class.
(A) Determination of the 5.0% load available for customer choice. For residential customers,
the load available for customer choice shall be determined by calculating 5.0% of the
number of ESIs in this customer class as of December 31, 2000. No later than January 31,
2001, the utility shall determine the amount of load available for this customer class and
shall make that information publicly available through its pilot project Internet website.
For this customer class, 20% of the 5.0% load available for customer choice shall be
initially set aside for each customer class (hereafter referred to as the 1.0% set-aside) for
aggregated loads.
(B) Initiating switching. Beginning February 15, 2001, a REP may accept authorizations to
switch providers from residential customers. A REP shall notify the utility of such
authorizations for residential customers.
(C) Reaching the 5.0% load limit. For purposes of this subparagraph the total number of ESIs
eligible to switch determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, less the number of
ESIs that have already authorized a switch, shall be referred to as the amount of available
load.
(i) As each customer in this class authorizes a switch to another provider, the amount
of available load shall be decremented by one.
(ii) When the amount of available load reaches zero, no more switch authorizations
shall be accepted.
(3) Non-residential customer classes.
(A) Determination of the 5.0% load available for customer choice. No later than January 31,
2001, the utility shall make the results of the following calculations for each non-residential
customer class publicly available through its pilot project Internet website. For each nonresidential customer class, 20% of the 5.0% load available for customer choice shall be
initially set aside for each customer class (hereafter referred to as the 1.0% set-aside) for
aggregated loads.
(i) Non-residential, non-demand metered customers. For non-residential, nondemand metered customers, the load available for customer choice shall be
determined by calculating 5.0% of the number of ESIs in that customer class as
of December 31, 2000.
(ii) Industrial demand-metered customers; commercial and all other demand-metered
customers. For each of the demand metered customer classes, the load available
for customer choice shall be determined by calculating 5.0% of the sum of the
kilowatts invoiced by the utility to all ESIs in each customer class for meter
reading dates during the utility’s peak demand month in the year 2000. In
addition, the utility shall determine the individual ESI load caps for each demand
metered customer class by calculating 20% of the load available for the pilot
project in each demand-metered customer class.
(iii) Other customers as defined in subsection (d)(2)(E) of this section. For all other
customers, the load available for customer choice shall be determined by
calculating 5.0% of the sum of the kilowatt-hours for which all ESIs in this
customer class were invoiced by the utility during the twelve month period ending
December 31, 2000. In addition, the utility shall determine the individual ESI
load caps for this customer class by calculating 20% of the kilowatt-hours
available for the pilot project in this customer class. 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(B) Amount of available load. For purposes of this paragraph, the total load available for
customer choice determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, less the amount of the
customer’s ESI load used for calculation in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, shall be
referred to as the amount of available load for each non-residential customer class. For an
ESI that was not included in the calculation in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph,
hereinafter called a new ESI, the customer’s ESI load shall be determined as follows:
(i) For the non-residential, non-demand metered class, a new ESI shall count as one
ESI against the total number of ESIs.
(ii) For the demand-metered classes, the demand allocated to a new ESI shall be 95%
of the utility-estimated demand for the new ESI.
(iii) For the other class as defined in subsection (d)(2)(E) of this section, the energy
allocated to a new ESI shall be 95% of the utility-estimated annual kilowatt-hours
for the new ESI.
(C) Open interest period. Beginning February 15, 2001, and continuing through March 15,
2001, interested customers may request the opportunity to participate in a utility’s pilot
project by submitting to the utility through its pilot project Internet website the account
number and zip code information necessary to determine the customer’s ESI. An eligible
ESI is one that does not exceed the individual ESI load cap established in subparagraph
(A) of this paragraph. By March 21, 2001, the utility shall determine if the non-residential
customer classes are either oversubscribed or undersubscribed, including the amount of
load oversubscribed or undersubscribed, and shall make such information publicly
available through its pilot project Internet website.
(i) Participant list. The utility shall create a list of customers eligible to participate
in the pilot project, referred to as the participant list. The participant list shall
include each ESI and related service address, the name in which the customer is
billed, and customer class as defined in this section. No later than March 21,
2001, the utility shall make available its integrated voice response (IVR) system
or its pilot project Internet website to allow a customer having an ESI in the lottery
to determine whether its ESI has been selected for the participant list. The
participant list for each customer class shall be provided to the commission no
later than March 21, 2001.
(ii) Oversubscription. On March 21, 2001, if a non-residential customer class is
oversubscribed, the utility shall use a lottery to develop the participant list. As
each ESI is selected through the lottery, the ESI’s load used for the calculation in
subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be subtracted from the total amount of
load available for customer choice as determined in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph. The ESI that causes the 4.0% load limit (i.e., the 5.0% load limit less
the 1.0% set-aside) to be reached shall be the final ESI selected through the
lottery; the 4.0% limit may be exceeded only for the purpose of accommodating
the entire load associated with the final ESI selected, except that such excess shall
not cause the amount of load available for customer choice to be greater than
4.1%. Once the 4.0% load limit is reached, the selected ESIs shall be included on
the participant list.
(iii) Undersubscription. If a non-residential customer class is undersubscribed, all
eligible ESIs submitted shall be included on the participant list. Beginning March
21, 2001, any unsubscribed load will be available for subscription by customers
in that customer class on a first come, first served basis.
(D) Negotiation period. Between March 21, 2001 and May 10, 2001, customers on the
participant list may negotiate and contract with REPs. A REP shall notify the utility of
execution of a contract. If a customer has not entered into a confirmed REP contract for a
specific ESI by May 10, 2001, that ESI shall be removed from the participant list, and the
load associated with that ESI shall be added to the amount of available load. On May 11,
2001, the utility shall post, on its pilot project Internet website, a list of submitted ESIs that 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
do not match a customer on the participant list. REPs shall have until May 14, 2001 to
correct any ESI listed by the utility on May 11, 2001. On May 17, 2001, the utility shall
determine the amount of available load for each non-residential customer class and shall
make such determination publicly available through its pilot project Internet website.
(E) Monitoring and adjusting the amount of available load. Following the negotiation period,
participation shall be allowed on a first come, first served basis.
(i) As each non-residential customer in a class executes a contract, the amount of
available load for that class shall be decremented by the amount of the customer’s
ESI load used for the calculation in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
(ii) The ESI that causes the amount of available load to reach zero shall be the final
ESI selected; the amount of available load may drop below zero only for the
purpose of accommodating the entire load associated with the final ESI selected,
subject to the limitations described in subparagraph (C)(ii) of this paragraph.
(4) Aggregated load set-aside. Customers participating in customer choice may use aggregation to the
extent they choose, and may participate by self aggregation or multiple customer aggregation. For
purposes of pilot project administration, aggregators must submit to the utility their groupings of
utility account numbers and associated zip codes, or ESIs if available, for participation in the pilot
project subject to the 1.0% set-aside. Such groupings (hereafter referred to as aggregation packets)
shall be submitted by customer class as defined in subsection (d) of this section with a listing of
utility account numbers and associated zip codes.
(A) Set-aside cap. No single aggregation packet may contain an ESI or ESIs that represent
more than 20% of the 1.0% set-aside for that customer class, with the exception of the
residential class.
(B) Registration dates. Aggregators may register non-residential customer class aggregation
packets, subject to the limitation in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, with the utility
beginning February 15, 2001. Aggregators may register residential aggregation packets
beginning March 1, 2001.
(C) Undersubscription for all non-residential customer classes. If an aggregation packet
contains non-residential ESIs from a class that is undersubscribed as of April 2, 2001, then
that aggregation packet shall have a reserved allotment of the 1.0% set-aside until May 21,
2001. If by May 31, 2001, the 1.0% set-aside for aggregation in any non-residential class
is undersubscribed, then the utility shall determine the unused class capacity and add it to
the amount of available load for that class. No later than June 10, 2001, the utility shall
make the updated amount of available load publicly available through the utility’s pilot
project Internet website.
(D) Aggregation selection process for customer classes. The eligibility for the 1.0% set-aside
for each customer class shall be determined as follows:
(i) Residential customer class. Beginning on March 1, 2001, an aggregator may
accept authorizations from residential customers to switch providers as a part of
an aggregation packet. Aggregators shall submit aggregated utility account
numbers and associated service address zip codes to the utility for tracking the
1.0% set-aside on a first come, first served basis. Aggregation packets shall be
accepted until either the 1.0% set-aside is reached or June 15, 2001, whichever
comes first. If the 1.0% set-aside is not fully subscribed by June 15, 2001, the
utility shall determine the unused class capacity and add that unused capacity to
the total amount of available load for the residential class.
(ii) Non-residential customer classes. The initial set-aside for each of the nonresidential customer classes shall be 1.0% of the eligible load by customer class.
To be eligible for the aggregation participant list, an aggregator must provide
utility account number and service address zip code information, or ESIs if
available, to the utility by April 2, 2001.
(I) Oversubscription for the non-residential, non-demand metered customer
class. If the total number of ESIs in aggregation packets submitted for 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
the pilot for a non-residential, non-demand class as of April 2, 2001
exceeds the 1.0% set-aside, then the utility shall use a lottery to
determine the aggregation participant list for this class. Aggregation
packets eligible for the aggregation participant list shall be selected by
the utility by April 5, 2001. As each aggregation packet is selected
through the lottery, the ESI count shall be subtracted from the total
number of ESI available for the 1.0% set-aside. Aggregation packets
shall be selected until none of the 1.0% set-aside is left. If the last
aggregation packet selected causes the 1.0% set-aside to be exceeded,
the selection of the final aggregation packet for this class shall be done
in accordance with subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. By April 6, 2001,
the utility shall determine whether an aggregation packet has been
selected, and shall make such information publicly available through its
pilot project Internet website.
(II) Oversubscription for the industrial demand-metered and commercial and
all other demand-metered classes. If the total combined load of all
aggregation packets submitted for each of the industrial demand-metered
and commercial and all other demand-metered classes exceeds the 1.0%
set-aside as of April 2, 2001, then the utility shall use a lottery to
determine the aggregation participant list for each customer class.
Aggregation packets eligible for the aggregation participant list shall be
selected by the utility by April 5, 2001. As an aggregation packet is
selected through the lottery, the demand for that ESI used to determine
the available capacity for that customer class shall be subtracted from the
total demand amount available for the 1.0% set-aside. Aggregation
packets shall be selected until none of the 1.0% set-aside is left. If the
last aggregation packet selected causes the 1.0% set-aside to be
exceeded, the selection of the final aggregation packet for the class shall
be done in accordance with subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. No later
than April 6, 2001, the utility shall make the list of ESIs eligible for the
pilot project publicly available through its pilot project Internet website.
(III) Oversubscription for the other customer class as defined in subsection
(d)(2)(e) of this section. If the total combined load of all aggregation
packets submitted for the other class exceeds the 1.0% set-aside as of
April 2, 2001, then the utility shall use a lottery to determine the
aggregation participant list for this class. Aggregation packets eligible
for the aggregation participant list shall be selected by the utility by April
5, 2001. As each aggregation packet is selected through the lottery, the
energy in kilowatt-hours for that ESI used to determine the size of the
customer class shall be subtracted from the total amount of energy
available for the 1.0% set-aside. Aggregation packets shall be selected
until none of the 1.0% set-aside is left. If the last aggregation packet
selected causes the 1.0% set-aside to be exceeded, the selection of the
final aggregation packet for the class shall be done in accordance with
subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. No later than April 6, 2001, the
utility shall make the list of ESIs eligible for the pilot project for the class
publicly available through its pilot project Internet website.
(E) Non-residential customer classes oversubscription lottery selection of last aggregation
packet. If the final aggregation packet chosen in a customer class lottery causes the 1.0%
set-aside for that customer class to be exceeded by more than 10%, that is, if that
aggregation packet increases the size of the customer class to greater than 1.1%, that
aggregation packet shall be rejected and another aggregation packet shall be chosen if
available. If no other aggregation packet is available to fill each non-residential customer 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter P. PILOT PROJECTS
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
class without exceeding the 10% overage limit, that remaining increment of capacity setaside will not be subscribed, but will be added to the amount of available capacity for
aggregation for that non-residential customer class and will be available on a first come,
first served basis. An aggregation packet that does not exceed the 10% overage limit will
be allowed. When the results of the oversubscription lottery are posted by the utility, the
utility shall also make publicly available the information concerning this available capacity
through its pilot project Internet website.
(F) Contract notification due date for non-residential customer classes. By May 21, 2001, a
REP must submit verification of executed supply contracts with ESIs and associated zip
code to the utility. Any ESI that has not been validated by a REP by this date will relinquish
its reserved allotment on the aggregation participant list. The relinquished allotment will
then be available for aggregation in that customer class on a first come, first served basis.
(G) Notification of executed contract for non-residential customer classes. The REP shall
document the existence of an executed contract for service by electronically submitting a
list of ESIs representing executed contracts to the utility. The utility may rely on receipt
of this list as proof of the existence of an executed contract. The REP shall file a signed
affidavit with the commission attesting to the accuracy of the ESIs on the list.
(H) Electronic submissions by aggregators. All submittals required by this section by
aggregators to a utility shall be made in electronic format using a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet using a spreadsheet template posted on the utility’s pilot project Internet
website. A utility will post its templates by January 31, 2001.
(I) New ESIs. For an ESI that was not included in the calculation in paragraph (3)(A) of this
subsection, hereinafter called a new ESI, the customer’s ESI load shall be determined as
follows:
(i) For the non-residential non-demand metered classes, a new ESI shall count as one
ESI against the total number of ESIs.
(ii) For the demand-metered classes, the demand allocated to a new ESI shall be 95%
of the utility-estimated demand for the new ESI.
(iii) For the other class as defined in subsection (d)(2)(E) of this section, the energy
allocated to a new ESI shall be 95% of the utility-estimated annual kilowatt-hours
for the new ESI.

Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
Effective 01/06/2022
(P 51830)
§25.471. General Provisions of Customer Protection Rules.
(a) Application. This subchapter applies to aggregators and retail electric providers (REPs). In addition, where
specifically stated, these rules apply to transmission and distribution utilities (TDUs), the registration agent,
brokers and power generation companies. These rules specify when certain provisions are applicable only to
some, but not all, of these providers.
(1) Affiliated REP customer protection rules, to the extent the rules differ from those applicable to all
REPs or those that apply to the provider of last resort (POLR), do not apply to the affiliated REP
when serving customers outside the geographic area served by its affiliated transmission and
distribution utility. The affiliated REP customer protection rules apply until the price-to-beat
obligation ends in the affiliated REPs’ affiliated TDU service territory.
(2) Requirements applicable to a POLR apply to a REP only in its provision of service as a POLR.
(3) The rules in this subchapter are minimum, mandatory requirements that must be offered to or
complied with for all customers unless otherwise specified. Except for the provisions of §25.495 of
this title (relating to Unauthorized Change of Retail Electric Provider), §25.481 of this title (relating
to Unauthorized Charges), §25.485(a)-(b) of this title (relating to Customer Access and Complaint
Handling), and §25.499 (relating to Acknowledgement of Risk Requirements for Certain
Commercial Contracts), a customer other than a residential or small commercial class customer, or
a non-residential customer whose load is part of an aggregation in excess of 50 kilowatts, may agree
to terms of service that reflect either a higher or lower level of customer protections than would
otherwise apply under these rules. Any agreements containing materially different protections from
those specified in these rules must be reduced to writing and provided to the customer. Additionally,
copies of such agreements must be provided to the commission upon request.
(4) The rules of this subchapter control over any inconsistent provisions, terms, or conditions of a
REP’s terms of service or other documents describing service offerings for customers in Texas.
(5) For purposes of this subchapter, a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative is subject to
the same provisions as a REP where the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative sells
retail electricity service outside its certificated service area.
(b) Purpose. The purposes of this subchapter are to:
(1) provide minimum standards for customer protection. An aggregator or REP may adopt higher
standards for customer protection, provided that the prohibition on discrimination set forth in
subsection (c) of this section is not violated;
(2) provide customer protections and disclosures established by other state and federal laws and
rules including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.) and
the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. §1601, et seq.). Such protections are applicable where
appropriate, whether or not it is explicitly stated in these rules;
(3) provide customers with sufficient information to make informed decisions about electric service
in a competitive market; and
(4) prohibit fraudulent, unfair, misleading, deceptive, or anticompetitive acts and practices by
aggregators, REPs, and brokers in the marketing, solicitation and sale of electric service, in the
administration of any terms of service for electric service and in providing advice or procurement
services to, or acting on behalf of, a retail electric customer regarding the selection of a retail
electric provider, or a product or service offered by a retail electric provider.
(c) Prohibition against discrimination. This subchapter prohibits REPs from unduly refusing to provide
electric service or otherwise unduly discriminating in the marketing and provision of electric service to any
customer because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, lawful source of income,
level of income, disability, familial status, location of customer in an economically distressed geographic
area, or qualification for low-income or energy efficiency services.

CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
Effective 3/8/17
P 45625
produce documentation of the pre-payment. The REP shall not submit a move-in or switch
request until it has received the prepayment from the customer.
(i) Record retention.
(1) A REP or aggregator shall maintain non-public records of each applicant’s authorization and

request.
(2) A REP or an aggregator shall submit copies of its sales script, terms of service document, and any
other materials used to obtain a customer’s authorization or verification to the commission staff
upon request. In the event commission staff request documents under this subsection, the requested

of the request.
(j) Right of rescission. A REP shall promptly provide the applicant with the terms of service document after
the applicant has authorized the REP to provide service to the applicant and the authorization has been
verified. For switch requests, the REP shall offer the applicant a right to rescind the terms of service without
penalty or fee of any kind for a period of three federal business days after the applicant’s receipt of the terms
of service document. The provider may assume that any delivery of the terms of service document deposited
first class with the United States Postal Service will be received by the applicant within three federal business

(k) Submission of an applicant’s switch or move-in request to the registration agent. A REP shall submit a
move-in or switch request to the registration agent so that the move-in or switch will be processed on the
approximate scheduled date agreed to by the applicant and as allowed by the tariff of the TDU, municipally
owned utility, or electric cooperative. A REP shall submit an applicant’s switch request to the registration
agent as a standard switch. In the alternative, the REP shall submit an applicant’s switch request as a selfselected switch if the applicant requests a specific date for a switch, consistent with the applicable
transmission and distribution tariff. A REP may submit an applicant’s switch request to the registration agent
prior to the expiration of the rescission period prescribed by subsection (j) of this section, provided that if the
customer makes a timely request to cancel service the REP shall take action to ensure that the switch is
canceled or the customer is promptly returned to its chosen REP without inconvenience or additional cost to
the customer. The applicant shall be informed of the approximate scheduled date that the applicant will begin
receiving electric service from the REP, and of any delays in meeting that date, if known by the REP.
(l) Duty of the registration agent.

notice to the applicant that shall:
(A) be worded in English and Spanish consistent with §25.473(d) of this title (relating to NonEnglish Language Requirements);
(B) identify the REP that initiated the switch request; and
(C) provide the names and telephone numbers for the gaining and losing REP.
(2) The registration agent shall direct the TDU to implement any switch, move-in, or transfer to the
REP or the POLR in accordance with this section and its protocols.
(m) Exemptions for certain transfers. The provisions of this section relating to authorization and right of
rescission are not applicable when the applicant’s or customer’s electric service is: 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
Effective 3/8/17
P 45625
(1) transferred to the POLR pursuant to §25.43 of this title (relating to Provider of Last Resort (POLR))
when the customer’s REP of record defaults or otherwise ceases to provide service. Nothing in this
subsection implies that the customer is accepting a contract with the POLR for a specific term;
(2) transferred to the competitive affiliate of the POLR pursuant to §25.43(o) of this title;
(3) transferred to another REP in accordance with section §25.493 of this title (relating to Acquisition
and Transfer of Customers from One Retail Electric Provider to Another); or
(4) transferred from one premise to another premise without a change in REP and without a material change
in the terms of service.
(n) Fees. A REP, other than a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative, shall not charge a fee to an
applicant to switch to, select, or enroll with the REP unless an applicant without a Provisioned Advanced
Meter requests an out-of-cycle meter read for the purpose of a self-selected switch. The registration agent
shall not charge a fee to the end-use customer for the switch or enrollment process performed by the
registration agent. The TDU shall not charge a fee for a review or adjustment described in subsection (p)(2)
of this section. To the extent that the TDU assesses a REP a properly tariffed charge for connection of
service, out-of-cycle meter read for self-selected switch requests, service order cancellations, or changes
associated with the switching of service or the establishment of new service, any such fee may be passed on
to the applicant or customer by the REP. A TDU shall not assess to a REP or an applicant any costs associated
with a switch cancellation, including inadvertent gain fees, that results from the applicant’s exercise of the
three-day right of rescission. The TDU shall include such costs in the cost recovery mechanism described in
subsection (o) of this section.
(o) TDU cost recovery. The TDU may recover the reasonable costs associated with performing meter reads for
purposes of a standard switch through one of the following two options at the TDU’s discretion:
(1) TDU costs associated with performing standard meter reads for the purpose of switches, to the extent
not reflected in base rates, shall be considered costs incurred in deploying advanced metering
functionality and are to be considered in setting a surcharge established under PURA §39.107 (h)
and §25.130 of this title (relating to Advanced Metering). The costs shall be included in the annual
reports filed pursuant to §25.130(k)(5) of this title as actual costs spent to date in the deployment of
Advanced Metering Systems (AMS) and shall be considered in setting, reconciling and or updating
the AMS surcharge pursuant to §25.130(k) of this title; or,
(2) a TDU shall create a regulatory asset for the expenses associated with performing standard meter
reads for the purpose of switches pursuant to this subsection. Upon review of reasonableness and
necessity, a reasonable level of amortization of such a regulatory asset, including carrying charges,
shall be included as a recoverable cost in the TDU’s rates in its next rate case or such other rate
recovery proceeding as deemed necessary.
(p) Meter reads for the purpose of a standard switch.
(1) Beginning December 1, 2009, a TDU shall perform actual, as opposed to estimated, meter reads for
at least 80% of meter reads for the purpose of a standard switch in any given month, and at least
95% of meter reads for the purpose of a standard switch in any calendar year, exclusive of remote
meter reads using advanced meters. Until December 1, 2009, a TDU may perform estimated meter
reads for standard switch requests only for residential customers, exclusive of customers with meters
that have remote read capability. A TDU shall use best efforts to perform as many actual reads as
possible for standard switches.
(2) Notwithstanding §25.214 of this title (relating to Terms and Conditions of Retail Delivery Service
Provided by Investor Owned Transmission and Distribution Utilities), an estimated meter read for
the purpose of a standard switch is not subject to adjustment, except as provided in subparagraph
(A) or (B) of this paragraph. A customer is obligated to pay a bill based upon an estimated meter
read for the purpose of a switch, including any adjustment made pursuant to subparagraph (A) or
(B) of this paragraph.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
Effective 3/8/17
P 45625
(A) The TDU shall adjust the estimated meter read if the losing REP’s billed usage is greater
than the total kilowatt-hours used by the customer in the TDU monthly meter read cycle
during which the estimate was made.
(B) Only upon the receipt of a customer dispute of the estimated usage to either the gaining or
losing REP, either REP may request the TDU to review the estimate. In reviewing the
estimate, the TDU shall promptly calculate the average actual kWh usage per day for the
time period from the actual meter reading occurring prior to the estimated reading to the
actual meter reading occurring after the estimated reading. The TDU shall determine
whether the usage per day for the estimated period prior to the switch is at least 25% greater
than, or 25% less than, the average actual kWh usage per day. If so, the TDU shall
promptly adjust the estimated meter read. The TDU may adjust an estimate that does not

(e) Compilation of scorecard data.
(1) The registration agent shall create and maintain a database of generator scorecards reflecting each
generation owner’s company-wide fuel mix and environmental impact data based on generating
facilities located in Texas.
(2) Each generation owner’s fuel mix and environmental impact data for the preceding calendar year
shall be published on the registration agent’s Internet web site by April 1 of each year and shall
state:
(A) the percentage of MWhs generated from each of the following fuel sources: coal and
lignite, natural gas, nuclear, renewable energy, and other sources; and
(B) the MWh-weighted average annual emissions rates in pounds per 1,000 kWh for the
aggregate generation sources of the generation owner for carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
particulates, sulfur dioxide, and spent nuclear fuel produced (with spent nuclear fuel
annualized using standard industry conversion factors).
(3) Not later than March 1 of each year, each generation owner shall report to the registration agent the
following data for the preceding calendar year: net generation in MWh from each of its generating
units in Texas; the type of fuel used by each of its generating units in Texas; and the MWh-weighted
average annual emissions rate, on an aggregate basis for all of its generating units in Texas (in
pounds per 1,000 kWh) for carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates, sulfur dioxide, and nuclear
waste. For purposes of calculating its average emissions rates, each generation owner shall rely
upon emissions data that it submits to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), or the best available data if the
generation owner does not submit pertinent data to the EPA or TCEQ. A generation owner shall
not be required to submit information to the registration agent regarding the net generation of its
generating units located within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region if, upon
request, the registration agent advises the owner of generation assets that it already has such
information available from its polled settlement meter data.
(4) Not later than April 1 of each year, the registration agent shall calculate and publish on its Internet
website a state average fuel mix, statewide system average emission rates for each type of emission,
and a default scorecard to account for all electric generation in the state that is not authenticated as
defined in subsection (c)(1) of this section.
(A) The default fuel mix shall be the percentage of total MWh of generation not authenticated
that has been obtained from each fuel type.
(B) Default emission rates for each type of emission shall be calculated by dividing total
pounds of emissions or waste by total MWh, using data only for generation not
authenticated.
(f) Calculating renewable generation and authenticating “green” claims.
(1) Not later than March 15 of each year, each REP shall report to the registration agent attestations
from power generators that the natural gas used to generate electricity supplied to the REP was
produced in Texas, if during the preceding calendar year and the current calendar year the REP
markets “green” electricity on the basis of that power.
(2) For power purchased from sources outside of Texas, a supply contract between a REP and the owner
of a generating facility may be used to authenticate the fuel mix for electricity generated at that
facility and sold at retail in Texas.
(A) The contract must identify a specific generating facility from which the REP has obtained
electricity that it sold to retail customers in Texas during the preceding calendar year.
(B) A REP that intends to rely upon a supply contract with an out-of-state generator to
authenticate fuel mix shall submit a report to the registration agent for the specified
generating facility no later than March 1 of each year that reports the facility’s annual fuel
mix.

(3) For the purposes of EFL disclosures, the retirement of RECs shall be the only method of
authenticating generation for which a REC has been issued under §25.173 of this title. The
retirement of a REC shall be equivalent to one megawatt-hour of generation from renewable
resources. The use of RECs to authenticate the use of renewable fuels must be consistent with REC
account information maintained by the Renewable Energy Credits Trading Program Administrator.
A REC offset may be used to authenticate the renewable attributes of the current MWh output from
its associated supply contract.
(4) In determining the renewable content percentages to be disclosed on the EFL for a product pursuant
to §25.475 of this title, the REP shall rely upon the following sources of information: the Texas
State Average Fuel Mix published by the registration agent under subsection (e) of this section;
retired RECs; and actual energy production during the calendar year from resources that are awarded
REC offsets by the REC program administrator. The REP may also rely on power purchased from
sources outside of Texas, if it has a supply contract with the owner of a generating facility and
submits a report to the registration agent concerning the fuel mix of the facility, in accordance with
this section.
(5) If a REP offers multiple electricity products that differ with regard to renewable energy content the
REP:
(A) may apply any supply contract to the calculation of any product EFL as long as the sum of
MWh applied does not exceed the MWh acquired under the contract; and
(B) may apply any number of RECs to the calculation of any product EFL as long as:
(i) the number of RECs applied to all product EFLs is consistent with the number of
RECs the retailer has retired with the REC Trading Program Administrator; and
(ii) the number of RECs applied to each product EFL results in a renewable energy
content for each product that is equal to or greater than a benchmark to be
calculated from data maintained by the REC Trading Program Administrator. The
benchmark shall be defined on an annual basis as:
SRR / TS,
where
SRR = the statewide REC requirement, in MWh, as calculated
by the REC Trading Program Administrator for the
compliance period coinciding with the EFL, and
TS = total MWh sales for all REPs to Texas customers during
the compliance period coinciding with the EFL.
(6) Any REP may anticipate the renewable content of a new product. The EFL shall state that the
renewable content is an estimate that will be verified.
(g) Fuel Mix for Renewable Energy.
(1) The fuel mix percentage for renewable energy shall be disclosed on the EFL for the product pursuant
to §25.475 of this title. The percentage used shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
(2) Renewable energy claims. A REP may authenticate its sales of renewable energy by requesting
that the program administrator of the renewable energy credits trading program established pursuant
to §25.173(d) of this title retire a renewable energy credit for each megawatt-hour of renewable
energy sold to its customers.
(h) Annual update. Each REP shall update its EFL for each of its currently offered products or products offered
during the preceding calendar year no later than July 1 of each year, so that the EFL displays the renewable
energy percentages determined pursuant to this section and reported to the registration agent for that product
for generation purchased during the preceding calendar year.

(4) A residential customer or applicant seeking to establish service with a REP other than an affiliated
REP or POLR can demonstrate satisfactory credit using one of the criteria listed in subparagraphs
(A) through (B) of this paragraph. Notice of these options for customers or applicants shall be
included in any written or oral notice to a customer or applicant when a deposit is requested. A REP
other than an affiliated REP or POLR may establish additional methods by which a customer or
applicant not meeting the criteria of subparagraphs (A) or (B) of this paragraph can demonstrate
satisfactory credit, so long as such criteria are not discriminatory pursuant to §25.471(c) of this title
(relating to General Provisions of Customer Protection Rules).
(A) The residential customer or applicant is 65 years of age or older and the customer is not
currently delinquent in payment of any electric service account.
(B) The customer or applicant has been determined to be a victim of family violence as defined
in the Texas Family Code §71.004, by a family violence center as defined in Texas Human
Resources Code §51.002, by treating medical personnel, by law enforcement personnel, by
the Office of a Texas District Attorney or County Attorney, by the Office of the Attorney
General, or by a grantee of the Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation. This
determination shall be evidenced by submission of a certification letter developed by the
Texas Council on Family Violence. The certification letter may be submitted directly by
use of a toll-free fax number to the REP.
(5) The REP may obtain payment history information from any REP that has served the applicant in the
previous two years or from a consumer reporting agency, as defined by the Federal Trade
Commission. The REP shall obtain the customer’s or applicant’s authorization prior to obtaining
such information from the customer’s or applicant’s prior REP. A REP shall maintain payment
history information for two years after a customer’s electric service has been terminated or
disconnected in order to be able to provide credit history information at the request of the former
customer.
(b) Credit requirements for non-residential customers. A REP may establish nondiscriminatory criteria
pursuant to §25.471(c) of this title to evaluate the credit requirements for a non-residential customer or
applicant and apply those criteria in a nondiscriminatory manner. If satisfactory credit cannot be
demonstrated by the non-residential customer or applicant using the criteria established by the REP, the
customer may be required to pay an initial or additional deposit. No such deposit shall be required if the
customer or applicant is a governmental entity.
(c) Initial deposits for applicants and existing customers.
(1) If satisfactory credit cannot be demonstrated by a residential applicant, a REP may require the
applicant to pay a deposit prior to receiving service.
(2) An affiliated REP or POLR shall offer a residential customer or applicant who is required to pay an
initial deposit the option of providing a written letter of guarantee pursuant to subsection (i) of this
section, instead of paying a cash deposit.
(3) A REP shall not require an initial deposit from an existing customer unless the customer was late
paying a bill more than once during the last 12 months of service or had service terminated or
disconnected for nonpayment during the last 12 months of service. The customer may be required
to pay this initial deposit within ten days after issuance of a written disconnection notice that
requests such deposit. The disconnection notice may be combined with or issued concurrently with
the request for deposit. The disconnection notice shall comply with the requirements in §25.483(m)
of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service).
(d) Additional deposits by existing customers.
(1) A REP may request an additional deposit from an existing customer if:
(A) the average of the customer’s actual billings for the last 12 months are at least twice the
amount of the original average of the estimated annual billings; and 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
(B) a termination or disconnection notice has been issued or the account disconnected within
the previous 12 months.
(2) A REP may require the customer to pay an additional deposit within ten days after the REP has
requested the additional deposit.
(3) A REP may disconnect service if the additional deposit is not paid within ten days of the request,
provided a written disconnection notice has been issued to the customer. A disconnection notice
may be combined with or issued concurrently with the written request for the additional deposit.
The disconnection notice shall comply with the requirements in §25.483(m) of this title.
(e) Amount of deposit.
(1) The total of all deposits, initial and additional, required by a REP from any residential customer or
applicant:
(A) shall not exceed an amount equivalent to the greater of:
(i) one-fifth of the customer’s estimated annual billing; or
(ii) the sum of the estimated billings for the next two months.
(B) A REP may base the estimated annual billing for initial deposits for applicants on a
reasonable estimate of average usage for the customer class. If a REP requests additional
or initial deposits from existing customers, the REP shall base the estimated annual billing
on the customer’s actual historical usage, to the extent that the historical usage is available.
After 12 months of service with a REP, a customer may request that a REP recalculate the
required deposit based on actual historical usage of the customer.
(2) For the purpose of determining the amount of the deposit, the estimated billings shall include only
charges for electric service that are disclosed in the REP’s terms of service document provided to
the customer or applicant.
(f) Interest on deposits. A REP that requires a deposit pursuant to this section shall pay interest on that deposit
at an annual rate at least equal to that set by the commission on or before December 1 of the preceding
calendar year, pursuant to Texas Utilities Code §183.003 (relating to Rate of Interest). If a deposit is refunded
within 30 days of the date of deposit, no interest payment is required. If the REP keeps the deposit more than
30 days, payment of interest shall be made from the date of deposit.
(1) Payment of the interest to the customer shall be made annually, if requested by the customer, or at
the time the deposit is returned or credited to the customer’s account.
(2) The deposit shall cease to draw interest on the date it is returned or credited to the customer’s
account.
(g) Notification to customers. When a REP requires a customer to pay a deposit, the REP shall provide the
customer written information about the provider’s deposit policy, the customer’s right to post a guarantee in
lieu of a cash deposit if applicable, how a customer may be refunded a deposit, and the circumstances under
which a provider may increase a deposit. These disclosures shall be included either in the Your Rights as a
Customer disclosure or the REP’s terms of service document.
(h) Records of deposits.

(A) the name and address of each depositor;
(B) the amount and date of the deposit; and
(C) each transaction concerning the deposit.
(2) A REP that collects a deposit shall issue a receipt of deposit to each customer or applicant paying a
deposit or reflect the deposit on the customer’s bill statement. A REP shall provide means for a
depositor to establish a claim if the receipt is lost.
(3) A REP shall maintain a record of each unclaimed deposit for at least four years.
(4) A REP shall make a reasonable effort to return unclaimed deposits.

(P 47343)
(i) Guarantees of residential customer accounts. A guarantee agreement in lieu of a cash deposit issued by
any REP, if applicable, shall conform to the following requirements:
(1) A guarantee agreement between a REP and a guarantor shall be in writing and shall be for no more
than the amount of deposit the provider would require on the customer’s account pursuant to
subsection (e) of this section. The amount of the guarantee shall be clearly indicated in the signed
agreement. The REP may require, as a condition of the continuation of the guarantee agreement,
that the guarantor remain a customer of the REP, have no past due balance, and have no more than
one late payment in a 12-month period during the term of the guarantee agreement.
(2) The guarantee shall be voided and returned to the guarantor according to the provisions of subsection
(j) of this section.
(3) Upon default by a residential customer, the guarantor of that customer’s account shall be responsible
for the unpaid balance of the account only up to the amount agreed to in the written agreement.
(4) If the guarantor ceases to be a customer of the REP or has more than one late payment in a 12-month
period during the term of the guarantee agreement, the provider may treat the guarantee agreement
as in default and demand a cash deposit from the residential customer as a condition of continuing
service.
(5) The REP shall provide written notification to the guarantor of the customer’s default, the amount
owed by the guarantor, and the due date for the amount owed.
(A) The REP shall allow the guarantor 16 days from the date of notification to pay the amount
owed on the defaulted account. If the sixteenth day falls on a holiday or weekend, the due
date shall be the next business day.
(B) The REP may transfer the amount owed on the defaulted account to the guarantor’s own
electric service bill provided the guaranteed amount owed is identified separately on the
bill as required by §25.479 of this title (relating to Issuance and Format of Bills).
(6) The REP may initiate disconnection for nonpayment of the guaranteed amount only if the
disconnection of service was disclosed in the written guarantee agreement, and only after proper
notice as described by paragraph (5) of this subsection or §25.483 of this title.
(j) Refunding deposits and voiding letters of guarantee.
(1) A deposit held by a REP shall be refunded when the customer has paid bills for service for 12
consecutive residential billings or for 24 consecutive non-residential billings without having any
late payments. A REP may refund the deposit to a customer via a bill credit. REPs shall comply
with this provision as soon as practicable, but no later than August 31, 2004.
(2) Once the REP is no longer the REP of record for a customer or if service is not established with the
REP, the REP shall either transfer the deposit plus accrued interest to the customer’s new REP or
promptly refund the deposit plus accrued interest to the customer, as agreed upon by the customer
and both REPs. The REP may subtract from the amount refunded any amounts still owed by the
customer to the REP. If the REP obtained a guarantee, such guarantee shall be cancelled to the
extent that it is not needed to satisfy any outstanding balance owed by the
customer. Alternatively, the REP may provide the guarantor with written documentation that the
contract has been cancelled to the extent that the guarantee is not needed to satisfy any outstanding
balance owed by the customer.
(3) If a customer’s or applicant’s service is not connected, or is disconnected, or the service is terminated
by the customer, the REP shall promptly void and return to the guarantor all letters of guarantee on
the account or provide written documentation that the guarantee agreement has been voided, or
refund the customer’s or applicant’s deposit plus accrued interest on the balance, if any, in excess
of the unpaid bills for service furnished. Similarly, if the guarantor’s service is not connected, or is
disconnected, or the service is terminated by the customer, the REP shall promptly void and return 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.

(P 47343)
to the guarantor all letters of guarantee or provide written documentation that the guarantees have
been voided. This provision does not apply when the customer or guarantor moves or changes the
address where service is provided, as long as the customer or guarantor remains a customer of the
REP.
(4) A REP shall terminate a guarantee agreement when the customer has paid its bills for 12 consecutive
months without service being disconnected for nonpayment and without having more than two
delinquent payments.
(k) Re-establishment of credit. A customer or applicant who previously has been a customer of the REP and
whose service has been terminated or disconnected for nonpayment of bills or theft of service by that
customer (meter tampering or bypassing of meter) may be required, before service is reinstated, to pay all
amounts due to the REP or execute a deferred payment agreement, if offered, and reestablish credit.
(l) Upon sale or transfer of company. Upon the sale or transfer of a REP or the designation of an alternative
POLR for the customer’s electric service, the seller or transferee shall provide the legal successor to the
original provider all deposit records.

billed, labeled “previous meter read,” and the meter reading at the end of the
period for which the customer is being billed, labeled “current meter read,” and
the dates of such readings;
(ii) the kind and number of units measured, including kWh, actual kilowatts (kW), or
kilovolt ampere (kVa);
(iii) if applicable, billed kW or kVa;
(iv) whether the bill was issued based on estimated usage; and
(v) any conversions from meter reading units to billing units, or any other calculations
to determine billing units from recording or other devices, or any other factors
used in determining the bill, unless the customer is provided conversion charts;
(O) Any amount owed under a written guarantee agreement, provided the guarantor was
previously notified in writing by the REP of an obligation on a guarantee as required by
§25.478 of this title (relating to Credit Requirements and Deposits);

customer’s bill, then the term in this paragraph must be used to identify that charge, and such term
and its definition must be easily located on the REP’s website and available to a customer free of
charge upon request. Nothing in this paragraph precludes a REP from aggregating transmission and
distribution utility (TDU) or REP charges. For any TDU charge(s) listed in this paragraph, the
amount billed by the REP must not exceed the amount of the TDU tariff charge(s). The label for
any TDU charge(s) may also identify the TDU that issued the charge(s). A REP may use a different
term than a defined term by adding or deleting a suffix, by adding the word “total” to a defined term,
where appropriate, changing the use of lowercase or capital letters or punctuation, or using the
acceptable abbreviation specified in this paragraph for a defined term. If an abbreviation other than
the acceptable abbreviation is used for the term, then the term must also be identified on the
customer’s bill.

(3) If the underbilling is $50 or more, the REP shall offer the customer a deferred payment plan option
for the same length of time as that of the underbilling. A deferred payment plan need not be offered
to a customer when the underpayment is due to theft of service.

(P 47343)
(4) The REP shall not charge interest on underbilled amounts unless such amounts are found to be the
result of theft of service (meter tampering, bypass, or diversion) by the customer. Interest on
underbilled amounts shall be compounded monthly at the annual rate, as set by the commission.
Interest shall accrue from the day the customer is found to have first stolen the service.
(5) If the REP adjusts the bills for a prior billing cycle, the adjustments shall be identified by account
and billing date or service period.
(f) Disputed bills. If there is a dispute between a customer and a REP about the REP’s bill for any service billed
on the retail electric bill, the REP shall promptly investigate and report the results to the customer. The REP
shall inform the customer of the complaint procedures of the commission pursuant to §25.485 of this title
(relating to Customer Access and Complaint Handling).
(g) Alternate payment programs or payment assistance.
(1) Notice required. When a customer contacts a REP and indicates inability to pay a bill or a need
for assistance with the bill payment, the REP shall inform the customer of all applicable payment
options and payment assistance programs that are offered by or available from the REP, such as bill
payment assistance, deferred payment plans, disconnection moratoriums for the ill, or low-income
energy assistance programs, and of the eligibility requirements and procedure for applying for each.
(2) Bill payment assistance programs.
(A) All REPs shall implement a bill payment assistance program for residential electric
customers. At a minimum, such a program shall solicit voluntary donations from
customers through the retail electric bills.
(B) A REP shall obtain a commitment from an assistance agency selected to disburse bill
payment assistance funds that the agency will not discriminate in the distribution of such
funds to customers based on the customer’s race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry,
sex, marital status, lawful source of income, disability, familial status, location of customer
in an economically distressed geographic area, or qualification for low-income
affordability or energy efficiency services.
(3) A REP shall provide, in a project established by the commission, information about its voluntary
bill payment assistance program for burned veterans. This information shall include the REP’s
name, the REP’s certification number, and a toll free telephone number and website address where
customers can obtain additional information. The commission will publish such information on the
commission website.
(h) Level and average payment plans. A REP shall make a level or average payment plan available to its
customers consistent with this subsection. A customer receiving service from a provider of last resort (POLR)
may be required to select a competitive product offered by the POLR REP to receive the level or average
payment plan.
(1) A REP shall make a level or average payment plan available to a customer who is not currently
delinquent in payment to the REP. A customer is delinquent in payment in the following
circumstances:
(A) A customer whose normal billing arrangement provides for payment after the rendition of
service is delinquent if the date specified for payment of a bill has passed and the customer
has not paid the full amount due.
(B) A customer whose normal billing arrangement provides for payment before the rendition
of service is delinquent if the customer has a negative balance on the account for electric
service.
(2) A REP shall reconcile any over- or under-payment consistent with the applicable terms of service,
which shall provide for reconciliation at least every twelve months. For a customer with an average
payment plan, a REP may recalculate the average consumption or average bill and adjust the
customer’s required minimum payment as frequently as every billing period. A REP may collect 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
Effective 5/13/18
(P 47343)
under-payments associated with a level payment plan from a customer over a period no less than
the reconciliation period or upon termination of service to the customer. A REP shall credit or
refund any over-payments associated with a level payment plan to the customer at each
reconciliation and upon termination of service to the customer. A REP may initiate its normal
collection activity if a customer fails to make a timely payment according to such a level or average
payment plan. All details concerning a level or average payment program shall be disclosed in the
customer’s terms of service document.
(3) If the customer is delinquent in payment when the level or average payment plan is established, the
REP may require the customer to pay no greater than 50% of the delinquent amount due. The REP
may require the remaining delinquent amount to be paid by the customer in equal installments over
at least five billing cycles unless the customer agrees to fewer installments or may include the
remaining delinquent amount in the calculation of the level or average payment amount. If the REP
requires installment payments, the REP shall provide the customer a copy of the deferred payment
plan in writing as described in subsection (j)(5) of this section.
(4) If the amount of the deferred balance does not appear on each bill the customer receives, the REP
shall inform the customer that the customer may call the REP at any time to determine the amount
that must be paid to be removed from the level or average payment plan.
(5) If the customer is delinquent in payment when the level or average payment plan is established, the
REP may apply a switch-hold at that time.
(6) Before the REP applies a switch-hold to a customer on a level or average payment plan, the REP
shall provide orally or in writing a clear explanation of the switch-hold process to the customer,
prior to the customer’s agreement to the plan. The explanation shall inform the customer as follows:
“If you enter into this plan concerning your past due amount, we will put a switch-hold on your
account. A switch-hold means that you will not be able to buy electricity from other companies
until you pay the total deferred balance. If we put a switch-hold on your account, it will be removed
after your deferred balance is paid and processed. While a switch-hold applies, if you are
disconnected for not paying, you will need to pay {us or company name}, to get your electricity
turned back on.”
(7) If the customer is not delinquent in payment when the level or average payment plan is established,
a switch-hold shall not be applied unless the plan is established pursuant to subsection (j)(2)(B)(ii)
of this section.
(8) The REP, through a standard market process, shall submit a request to remove the switch-hold,
pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, when the customer satisfies either subparagraph (A) or
(B) of this paragraph, whichever occurs earlier. On the date the REP submits the request to remove
the switch-hold, the REP shall notify or send notice to the customer that the customer has satisfied
the obligation to pay any deferred balance owed and the removal of the switch-hold is being
processed.
(A) The customer’s deferred balance, including any deferred delinquent amount described in
paragraph (4) of this subsection, is either zero or in an over-payment status.
(B) The customer satisfies the terms of any deferred delinquent amount described in paragraph
(4) of this subsection and has paid bills for 12 consecutive billings without having been
disconnected and without having more than one late payment.
(i) Payment arrangements. A payment arrangement is any agreement between the REP and a customer that
allows a customer to pay the outstanding bill after its due date, but before the due date of the next bill. If the
REP issues a disconnection notice before a payment arrangement was made, that disconnection should be
suspended until after the due date for the payment arrangement. If a customer does not fulfill the terms of
the payment arrangement, service may be disconnected after the later of the due date for the payment
arrangement or the disconnection date indicated in the notice, without issuing an additional disconnection
notice.

(j) Deferred payment plans and other alternate payment arrangements.
(1) A deferred payment plan is an agreement between the REP and a customer that allows a customer
to pay an outstanding balance in installments that extend beyond the due date of the current bill. A
deferred payment plan may be established in person, by telephone, or online, but all deferred
payment plans shall be confirmed in writing by the REP in accordance with paragraph (5) of this
subsection. Before the REP applies a switch-hold to a customer on a deferred payment plan, the
REP shall provide a clear explanation of the switch-hold process to the customer. The explanation
shall inform the customer as follows: “If you enter into this plan concerning your past due amount,
we will put a switch-hold on your account. A switch-hold means that you will not be able to buy
electricity from other companies until you pay the total deferred balance. If we put a switch-hold
on your account, it will be removed after your deferred balance is paid and processed. While a
switch-hold applies, if you are disconnected for not paying, you will need to pay {us or company
name}, to get your electricity turned back on.”

that meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for a bill that becomes due in
January or February if in the prior month a TDU notified the commission pursuant to §25.483(j) of
this title of an extreme weather emergency for the residential customer’s county in the TDU service
area for at least five consecutive days during the month. A REP is not required to offer a payment
plan to a customer pursuant to this paragraph if the customer is on an existing deferred, level, or
average payment plan.
(A) The following residential customers are eligible for a payment plan under this paragraph:
(i) customers designated as Critical Care Residential Customers or Chronic
Condition Residential Customers under §25.497 of this title (relating to Critical

number of REP).”;
(B) if a switch-hold will apply, shall include a statement, in a clear and conspicuous type, that
states “By entering into this agreement, you understand that {company name} will put a
switch-hold on your account. A switch-hold means that you will not be able to buy
electricity from other companies until you pay this past due amount. The switch-hold will
be removed after your final payment on this past due amount is processed. While a switchhold applies, if you are disconnected for not paying, you will need to pay {us or company

notify or send notice to the customer that the customer has satisfied the obligation to pay any
deferred balance owed and the removal of the switch-hold is being processed.
(k) Allocation of partial payments. A REP shall allocate a partial payment by the customer first to the oldest

(l) Switch-hold.
(1) A REP may request that the TDU place a switch-hold on an ESI ID to the extent allowed by
subsection (h) or (j) of this section, which shall prevent a switch transaction from being completed
for the ESI ID and shall prevent a move-in transaction from being completed pending documentation
that the applicant for electric service is a new occupant not associated with the customer for which
the switch-hold was imposed. If the REP exercises its right to disconnect service for non-payment
pursuant to §25.483 of this title, the switch-hold shall continue to remain in place. The TDU shall
create and maintain a secure list of ESI IDs with switch-holds that REPs may access. The list shall
not include any customer information other than the ESI ID and date the switch-hold was placed.
The list shall be updated daily, and made available through a secure means by the TDU. The TDU
may provide this list in a secure format through the web portal developed as part of its AMS
deployment.
(A) The REP via a standard market process may request a switch-hold.
(B) The REP shall submit a request to remove the switch-hold as required by subsections (h)(9)
and (j)(8) of this section.

(D) At the time of a mass transition, the TDU shall remove the switch-hold flag for any ESI ID
that is transitioned to a provider of last resort (POLR) provider.
(E) When the applicant for electric service is shown to be a new occupant not associated with
the customer for which the switch-hold was imposed using the switch-hold process
described in §25.126 of this title, the switch-hold flag shall be removed.
(F) For a move-in transaction indicating that the ESI ID is subject to a continuous service
agreement, the TDU shall remove any switch-hold on that ESI ID and complete the movein.
(2) In the first TX SET release after January 1, 2011, market transactions shall be developed that support
the following requirements.
(A) REPs may request a switch-hold as allowed by subsection (h) or (j) of this section.
(B) TDUs shall provide indication of which ESI IDs have switch-holds so that during
a move-in enrollment a REP can identify whether a switch-hold applies and that
specific documentation must be submitted to have the switch-hold removed.
(C) A move-in subject to a switch-hold can be submitted for processing when the
customer initially requests the move-in and such transaction will be held in the
system for final processing depending on the approval or rejection of the move-in
documentation. The TDU shall notify the submitting REP that there is a switchhold on the ESI ID.
(3) The requirements of §25.475 of this title (relating to General Retail Electric Provider Requirements
and Information Disclosures to Residential and Small Commercial Customers) shall continue to
apply while a customer is subject to a switch-hold. The notice required by §25.475(e) of this title
shall include a statement reminding the customer that if a switch-hold is in effect, the balance
deferred must be paid in full before the customer will be able to change to a new provider.
(4) A customer who is subject to a switch-hold shall not be charged any separate fees for a switch-hold
or any customer service or administrative fees related to the switch-hold.

under the switch-hold, the REP shall provide notice of the contract expiration as required by §25.475
of this title. Unless a customer affirmatively chooses a different product with the REP, a customer
whose term product expires while the customer is subject to a switch-hold shall be moved to the
lowest priced month-to-month product currently offered by the REP to new applicants, or, if the

REP does not offer month-to-month products to new applicants, shall be served on a month-tomonth basis at the price equivalent to the lowest price of the shortest term fixed product currently
offered by the REP to new applicants. Otherwise, the REP shall request the removal of the switchhold in compliance with subsection (m) of this section. The offers shall include those made on
www.powertochoose.com. If the customer does not affirmatively choose a product, the customer
shall not be required by the REP to enter into another contract term so long as the switch-hold
remains on the customer account and no early termination fees shall be applied to the customer’s
account.
(m) Placement and Removal of Switch-Holds.
(1) A REP may request a switch-hold only as allowed under this section.
(2) A REP shall be responsible for requesting that the TDU remove a switch-hold after the customer’s
obligation to the REP related to the switch-hold is satisfied. If a customer’s obligation to the REP
is satisfied by 10:00 p.m. on a business day, the REP shall send a request to the TDU to remove the
switch-hold by Noon (12:00 p.m.) of the next business day. If the TDU receives the request by 1:00

expiration date.
(4) If a REP erroneously places a switch-hold flag on an ESI ID, thus preventing a legitimate switch, or
does not remove the switch-hold within the timeline described in paragraph (2) of this subsection,
the REP shall be considered to have committed a Class B Violation (as defined in §25.8(b) of this
title (relating to Classification System for Violations of Statutes, Rules, and Orders Applicable to
Electric Service Providers)) for purposes of any administrative penalties imposed by the
commission.
(n) Annual reporting requirement. In its annual report filed pursuant to §25.107 of this title (relating to
Certification of Retail Electric Providers (REPs)) and §25.491 of this title (relating to Record Retention and
Reporting Requirements), each REP shall include:

service; and
(B) file an affidavit from an officer of the company, in a project established by the commission
for this purpose, affirming that the REP understands and has trained its personnel on the
commission’s rule requirements related to disconnection and reconnection, and has
adequately tested the transactions described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
(c) Disconnection with notice. A REP having disconnection authority under the provisions of subsection (b)
of this section, including the POLR, may authorize the disconnection of a customer’s electric service after
proper notice and not before the first day after the disconnection date in the notice for any of the following
reasons:

TDU executes the move-in by connecting service to the premise. The date the TDU executes the
move-in by connecting service to the premise is the effective date for all wires charges and fees
associated with that ESI ID. This date will also be the effective date for the move-in when the
applicable move-in electronic transactions are processed. The TDU may bill monthly wires charges
and fees to the REP commencing with the effective date, but may not issue wires charges and fees
or consumption records until the REP submits the electronic transaction.
(2) The REP shall ensure that the standard electronic move-in transaction is submitted to ERCOT in
accordance with applicable protocols on or before the fifth business day after submitting the movein through the safety net process, even if the physical move-in has already taken place as a result of
being submitted through the safety net process. The REP, ERCOT, and the TDU shall work to
ensure that the appropriate premise information and enrollment response transaction is sent to and
received by the new REP and that the appropriate drop (due to switch request) transaction is sent to
the losing REP of record as shown in ERCOT’s systems.
(e) Sunset provision for review of safety-net process. By March 1, 2004, the commission shall, after input
provided by market participants, review the safety-net process and determine whether it should be continued.

constitute unauthorized use of service under the TDU’s tariff for retail delivery service approved pursuant to
§25.214 of this title (relating to Terms and Conditions of Retail Delivery Service Provided by Investor Owned
Transmission and Distribution Utilities).
(g) Format of notice. The notice provided by the TDU to a customer on the final list of accounts with no REP
of record shall have the identifying code #999 printed in bold letters to enable the REPs to identify customers

DISCONNECT NOTICE
Code #999
The State of Texas requires all customers to have a Retail Electric Provider (REP) before receiving
electric service. Our records indicate that you do not have a REP and are not receiving bills for electric
service. Thus, you have not been billed for the electricity used at these premises.
In order to avoid any disruption in your service, you must select and enroll with a REP no more than ten
days from the date of this notice. To ensure proper identification of your premise, please inform the
REP you have a Code 999 order to process. If you do not enroll with a REP within ten days, electricity
to this address will be disconnected.
If you have already contacted a REP to set up an electric service account, we urge you to contact your
REP to check the status of your request to avoid disconnection of service.
A list of REPs is listed on this notice. If you have selected a REP and believe this notice is in error,
please contact your REP immediately. You may call the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC)
toll-free at 1-888-782-8477 to address any questions that your REP cannot answer.
(2) A comprehensive list of REPs serving residential customers in the TDU’s territory, including each
REP’s toll-free number and website address (if available), shall be listed on the notice provided to
residential premises. A comprehensive list of REPs serving commercial customers in the TDU’s
territory, including each company’s toll-free number and website address (if available), shall be
listed on the notice provided to commercial premises.
(h) REP obligation to submit move-in transaction. A REP that enrolls a premise in response to the TDU
notice shall submit a move-in transaction, not a switch transaction, to the registration agent in accordance
with the requirements of §25.487 of this title (relating to Obligations Related to Move-In Transactions).
(i) Disconnection of premise with no REP of record. Each TDU may disconnect a premise with no REP of
record no earlier than ten days after the customer receives the TDU’s notification required by this section.
Prior to disconnecting the service for a premise with no REP of record, each TDU shall repeat the procedures
listed in subsection (c) of this section (other than issuing notice) to prevent the disconnection of a customer
who has initiated service with a REP. A TDU shall not disconnect any premise that has been claimed by a
REP in accordance with this section.
(j) Expedited reconnection of premise. If a TDU disconnects a premise in error, the TDU shall reconnect a
premise on an expedited basis in accordance with its tariff and commission rules, whichever process is
shorter.

receiving a move-out transaction unless the requirements of subsection (d) of this section have been met.
(c) Reporting requirement.
(1) A TDU shall report monthly to the commission its success rate in processing standard electronic
move-in requests for residential customers. The success rate shall be measured based on whether
the meter read and energizing of the premise is accomplished on the scheduled date. The report
shall omit backdated move-in requests.
(2) A TDU shall also report to the commission its success rate in processing requests for reconnection
of electric service. The success rate shall be measured based on whether the re-energizing of the
premise is accomplished on the scheduled date.
(3) The reports shall be filed with the commission on or before the 15th day of the month following the
last day of the reporting month.
(d) Relaxation of moratorium on disconnection. Upon approval from commission staff, a TDU may
disconnect residential premises after receiving a move-out transaction, as defined in the ERCOT protocols.
To achieve approval, the TDU must demonstrate through reports filed in accordance with subsection (c) of
this section that it has for three consecutive months or more processed 95% or greater of all move-ins and
requests for reconnection of electric service no later than the scheduled date. If a TDU’s success rate falls
below 95% for two consecutive months or below 90% in any one month, the TDU shall immediately notify
commission staff in writing, and commission approval shall be automatically revoked.
(e) Elimination of reporting requirement. Once a TDU demonstrates a 95% success rate in completing
reconnections and move-ins on the scheduled date for 12 consecutive months, it shall no longer be required
to submit monthly reports, as required by subsection (c) of this section. However, upon request by the
commission, a TDU shall file a report on its current success rate.
(f) Notice of moratorium status. The TDU shall notify each REP in its service territory each time it changes
its status, pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, concerning the moratorium on move-out disconnections.

(4) The affected REPs, the registration agent, and the TDU must take all actions necessary to bill
correctly all charges, so that the end result is that:
(A) the REP that served the customer without proper authorization must pay all transmission
and distribution charges associated with returning the customer to its original REP, or REP
of choice in the case of a move-in;
(B) the original REP has the right to bill the customer under §25.480 of this title (relating to
Bill Payment and Adjustments) at the price disclosed in its terms of service from either:
(i) the date the customer is returned to the original REP; or
(ii) any prior date chosen by the original REP for which the original REP had the
authorization to serve the customer.
(C) the REP that served the customer without proper authorization must refund all charges paid
by the customer for the time period for which the original REP ultimately bills the customer
within five business days after the customer is returned to the original REP, or REP of
choice in the case of a move-in;
(D) the customer will pay no more than the price at which the customer would have been billed
had the unauthorized switch or move-in not occurred;
(E) the TDU has the right to seek collection of non-bypassable charges from the REP that
ultimately bills the customer under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph; and
(F) the REP that ultimately bills the customer under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is
responsible for non-bypassable charges and wholesale consumption for the customer.
(5) The original REP must provide the customer all benefits or gifts associated with the service that
would have been awarded had the unauthorized switch or move-in not occurred, upon receiving
payment for service provided during the unauthorized change.
(6) The affected REPs must communicate with the customer as appropriate throughout the process of
returning the customer to the original REP or REP of choice and resolving any associated billing
issues.
(7) In a circumstance where paragraph (4) of this subsection is not applicable or its requirements cannot
be effectuated, the market participants involved must work together in good faith to rectify the
unauthorized switch or move-in in a manner that affords the customer and market participants
involved a level of protection comparable to that required in this subsection.

(d) Notice to customers concerning Critical Care Residential Customer and Chronic Condition
Residential Customer status.
(1) A REP shall notify each residential applicant for service of the right to apply for Critical Care
Residential Customer or Chronic Condition Residential Customer designation. This notice to an
applicant for residential service shall be included in the Your Rights as a Customer document.
(2) All REPs that serve residential customers shall provide information about Critical Care Residential
Customer and Chronic Condition Residential Customer designations to each residential customer
two times a year.
(3) Upon a customer’s request, the REP shall provide to the customer the application form for Critical
Care Residential Customer and Chronic Condition Residential Customer designation.

Customer designation.
(1) The commission-approved application form shall instruct the customer to have the physician submit
the application form by facsimile or other electronic means to the TDU. If the physician submits
the form to the REP, the REP shall forward it to the TDU electronically no later than two business
days from receipt of the form. The application form shall include a telephone number for reaching
a person at the TDU who is capable of responding to questions from a physician or customer about
the form during regular business hours.
(2) After the TDU receives the form, it shall evaluate the form for completeness. If the form is
incomplete, no later than two business days after receiving the form, the TDU shall mail the form
to the customer and explain in writing what information is needed to complete the form.
(3) If the TDU has returned the form as incomplete or has not finished processing the form within two
business days from receipt of the form, the customer shall be designated as a Critical Care
Residential Customer or Chronic Condition Residential Customer on a temporary basis pending
final designation by the TDU. The temporary designation shall be based on the designation selected
by the physician on the form if such designation was included; otherwise, the temporary designation
shall be as a Critical Care Residential Customer. The TDU shall notify the customer’s REP of such
temporary designation using a standard market transaction. If the form is returned to the customer
as incomplete, the temporary designation shall remain in effect for 14 days, after which the
temporary designation shall expire and the application process must start over.
(4) Reasons that a TDU shall consider a form incomplete for an application for Critical Care Residential
Customer or Chronic Condition Residential Customer designation include the omission of the name
of the person for whom the protection is sought, contact information, physician signature, the
designation as a Critical Care Residential Customer or Chronic Condition Residential Customer,
and medical board license number of the customer’s physician. Any additional mandatory
information required for completeness shall be clearly identified on the commission-approved
application form. A customer may, but it is not required to, include an emergency (secondary)
contact in the application.
(5) The TDU shall not challenge the physician’s determination of the customer’s status, but shall apply
the physician’s designation of the customer as a Critical Care Residential Customer or Chronic
Condition Residential Customer consistent with the information provided on the form and the
definitions in this section. The TDU may verify the physician’s identity and signature and may deny
an application for designation, if it determines that the identity or signature of the physician is not
authentic.
(6) The TDU shall notify the customer’s REP using a standard market transaction and the customer of
the final status of the application process, including whether the customer has been designated for

title (relating to Advanced Metering) and in which the TDU-provided portal does not
provide the REP the ability to obtain on-demand usage data.
(12) A REP providing service must not charge a customer any fee for:
(A) transitioning from a prepaid service to a postpaid service, but notwithstanding
§25.478(c)(3) of this title (relating to Credit Requirements and Deposits), a REP may
require the customer to pay a deposit for postpaid service consistent with §25.478(b) or

right to pay the remaining deferred balance by reducing the deferred balance by five equal
monthly installments. However, the customer can agree to fewer or more frequent
installments. The installments to repay the deferred balance must be applied to the
customer’s account on a specified day of each month.
(7) The REP may initiate disconnection of service if the customer does not meet the terms of a deferred
payment plan or if the customer’s current balance falls below the disconnection balance, excluding
the remaining deferred amount. However, the REP must not initiate disconnection of service unless
it has provided the customer at least one day’s notice that the customer has not met the terms of the

any questions regarding the terms of this agreement, or if the agreement was made by
telephone and you believe this does not reflect your understanding of that agreement,
contact (insert name and contact number of REP).”
(B) If a switch-hold will apply, the plan must include a statement, in a clear and conspicuous
type, that states “By entering into this agreement, you understand that {company name}
will put a switch-hold on your account. A switch-hold means that you will not be able to
buy electricity from other companies until you pay this past due amount. The switch-hold
will be removed after your final payment on this past due amount is processed. While a
switch-hold applies, if you are disconnected for not paying, you will need to pay {us or
company name}, to get your electricity turned back on.”
(C) If the customer and the REP’s representative or agent meet in person, the representative
must read to the customer the statement in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and, if
applicable, the statement in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
(D) The plan may include a one-time penalty in accordance with §25.480(c) of this title, but
must not include a finance charge.
(E) The plan must include the terms for payment of deferred amounts, consistent with
paragraph (6) of this subsection.
(F) The plan must state the total amount to be paid under the plan.
(G) The plan must state that a customer’s electric service may be disconnected if the customer
does not fulfill the terms of the deferred payment plan, or if the customer’s current balance
falls below the disconnection balance, excluding the remaining deferred amount.
(10) The REP must not charge the customer a fee for placing the customer on a deferred payment plan.
(11) The REP, through a standard market process, must submit a request to remove the switch-hold,
pursuant to §25.480(m)(2) of this title if the customer pays the deferred balance owed to the REP.
On the day the REP submits the request to remove the switch-hold, the REP must notify the customer
that the customer has satisfied the deferred payment plan and that the switch-hold is being removed.

(j) Disconnection of service. As provided by subsection (a)(4) of this section, §25.483 (b)(2)(A) and (B), (d),
(e)(1)-(6), and the definition of extreme weather in §25.483(j)(1) of this title apply to prepaid service. In
addition to those provisions, this subsection applies to disconnection of a customer receiving prepaid service.
(1) Prohibition on disconnection. A REP must not initiate disconnection for a customer’s failure to
maintain a current balance above the disconnection balance on a weekend day or during any period
during which the mechanisms used for payments specified in the customer’s PDS are unavailable;
or during an extreme weather emergency, as this term is defined in §25.483 of this title, in the county
in which the service is provided.
(2) Initiation of disconnection. A REP may initiate disconnection of service when the current balance
falls below the disconnection balance, but only if the REP provided the customer a timely warning
pursuant to subsection (c)(7)(D) of this section; or when a customer fails to comply with a deferred
payment plan, but only if the REP provided the customer a timely warning pursuant to subsection
(i)(7) of this section. A REP may initiate disconnection if the customer’s current balance falls below
the disconnection balance due to reversal of a payment found to have insufficient funds available or
is otherwise rejected by a bank, credit card company, or other payor.
(3) Pledge from electric assistance agencies. If a REP receives a pledge, letter of intent, purchase
order, or other commitment from an energy assistance agency to make a payment for a customer,
the REP must immediately credit the customer’s current balance with the amount of the pledge.
(A) The REP must not initiate disconnection of service if the pledge from the energy assistance
agency (or energy assistance agencies) establishes a current balance above the customer’s
disconnection balance or, if the customer has been disconnected, must request reconnection
of service if the pledge from the energy assistance agency establishes a current balance for
the customer that is at or above the customer’s connection balance required for
reconnection.
(B) The REP may initiate disconnection of service if payment from the energy assistance
agency is not received within 45 days of the REP’s receipt of the commitment or if the
payment is not sufficient to satisfy the customer’s disconnection balance in the case of a
currently energized customer, or the customer’s connection balance if the customer has
been disconnected for falling below the disconnection balance.
(4) Reconnection of service. Within one hour of a customer establishing a connection balance or any
otherwise satisfactory correction of the reasons for disconnection, the REP must request that the
TDU reconnect service or, if the REP disconnected service using its CPDS, reconnect service. The
REP’s payment mechanism may include a requirement that the customer verify the payment using
a card, code, or other similar method in order to establish a connection balance or current balance
above the disconnection balance when payment is made to a third-party processor acting as an agent
of the REP.
(k) Service to Critical Care Residential Customers and Chronic Condition Residential Customers. A REP
must not knowingly provide prepaid service to a customer who is a critical care residential customer or
chronic condition residential customer as those terms are defined in §25.497 of this title. In addition, a REP
must not enroll an applicant who states that the applicant is a critical care residential customer or chronic
condition residential customer.
(1) If the REP is notified by the TDU that a customer receiving prepaid service is designated as a critical
care residential customer or chronic condition residential customer, the REP must diligently work
with the customer to promptly transition the customer to postpaid service or another REP in a
manner that avoids a service disruption. The REP must not charge the customer a fee for the
transition, including an early termination or disconnection fee.
(2) If the customer is unresponsive, the REP must transfer the customer to a competitively offered,
month-to-month postpaid product at a rate no higher than the rate calculated pursuant to
§25.43(l)(2)(A) of this title. The REP must provide the customer notice that the customer has been 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter R. CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES FOR RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE.
Effective 1/6/22
(P 51830)
transferred to a new product and must provide the customer the new product’s Terms of Service and
EFL.
(l) Compliance period. No later than October 1, 2011, prepaid service offered by a REP pursuant to a new
contract to a customer being served using a “settlement provisioned meter,” as that term is defined in Chapter
1 of the TDU’s tariff for retail delivery service, or using a REP-controlled collar or meter must comply with
this section. Before October 1, 2011, prepaid service offered by a REP to a customer served using a
settlement provisioned meter or REP-controlled collar or meter must comply with this section as it currently
exists or as it existed in 2010, except as provided in subsection (m) of this section.
(m) Transition of Financial Prepaid Service Customers. A REP may continue to provide a financial prepaid
service (i.e., one that does not use a settlement provisioned meter or REP-controlled collar or meter) only to
its customer that was receiving financial prepaid service at a particular location on October 1, 2011. A
customer who is served by a financial prepaid service must be transitioned to a service that complies with
the other subsections of this section by the later of October 1, 2011 or sixty days after the customer begins
to be served using either a settlement provisioned meter or a REP-controlled collar or meter. The customer
must be notified by the REP that the customer’s current prepaid service will no longer be offered as of a
date specified by the REP by the later of either October 1, 2011 or sixty days after the customer begins to
be served using either a settlement provisioned meter or REP-controlled collar or meter, as applicable. The
REP must provide the notification no sooner than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the termination
of the customer’s current prepaid service. The customer must be notified that the customer will be moved
to a new prepaid service, and the REP must transmit an EFL and PDS to the customer with the notification,
if the customer does not choose another service or REP.

§25.499. Acknowledgement of Risk Requirements for Certain Commercial Contracts.
(a) Purpose. This section establishes requirements for the offering of wholesale indexed products and products
containing separate assessment of ancillary services costs to a customer other than a residential or small
commercial customer.
(b) Application. This section applies to all retail electric providers (REPs), aggregators and brokers. The
Acknowledgement of Risk (AOR) for wholesale indexed products required by this section is effective for
enrollments or re-enrollments entered into on or after September 1, 2021. The AOR required for other
product types required under this section are effective for enrollments or re-enrollments entered into on or
after April 1, 2021. REPs are not required to modify contract documents related to contracts or enrollments
entered into before this date.
(c) Definitions. The definitions set forth in §25.5 (relating to Definitions) and §25.471(d) (relating to General
Provisions of Customer Protection Rules) of this title apply to this section. In addition, wholesale indexed
product, when used in this section, means a retail electric product in which the price a customer pays for
electricity includes a direct pass-through of real-time settlement point prices determined by the independent
organization certified under the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §39.151 for the ERCOT power
region.
(d) Acknowledgement of Risk (AOR). Before a customer other than a residential or small commercial
customer is enrolled in a wholesale indexed product, or a product that contains a separate assessment of
ancillary service charges, an aggregator, broker, or REP must obtain an AOR, signed by the customer,
verifying that the customer accepts the potential price risks associated with the product.
(1) For Wholesale Indexed Products, the AOR must include the following statement in clear, boldfaced
text: “I understand that the volatility and fluctuation of wholesale energy pricing may cause my
energy bill to be multiple times higher in a month in which wholesale energy prices are high. I
understand that I will be responsible for charges caused by fluctuations in wholesale energy prices.”
(2) For products that contain a separate assessment of ancillary service charges the AOR must include
the following statement in clear, boldfaced text: “I understand that my energy bill may include a
separate assessment of ancillary service charges, which may cause my energy bill to be multiple
times higher in a month in which ancillary services charges are high. I understand that I will be
responsible for charges caused by fluctuations in ancillary service charges.”
(3) An AOR may be included as an addendum to a contract.
(4) A REP, aggregator, or broker must retain a record of the AORs for each customer during the time
the applicable plan is in effect and for four years after the contract ceases to be in effect for any
customer. A REP must provide such documents at the request of the commission or its staff.

Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.501--1 effective date 4/18/12
(P 39917)
§25.501. Wholesale Market Design for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
(a) General. The protocols and other rules and requirements of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
(ERCOT) that implement this section shall be developed with consideration of microeconomic principles and
shall promote economic efficiency in the production and consumption of electricity; support wholesale and
retail competition; support the reliability of electric service; and reflect the physical realities of the ERCOT
electric system. Except as otherwise directed by the commission, ERCOT shall determine the market clearing
prices of energy and other ancillary services that it procures through auctions and the congestion rents that it
charges or credits, using economic concepts and principles such as: shadow price of a constraint, marginal
cost pricing, and maximizing the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
(b) Bilateral markets and default provision of energy and ancillary capacity services. ERCOT shall permit
market participants to self-arrange (self-schedule or bilaterally contract for) energy and ancillary capacity
services, except to the extent that doing so would adversely impact ERCOT’s ability to maintain reliability.
To the extent that a market participant does not self-arrange the energy and ancillary capacity services
necessary to meet its obligations or to the extent that ERCOT determines that the market participant’s selfarranged ancillary services will not be delivered, ERCOT shall procure energy and ancillary capacity services
on behalf of the market participant to cover the shortfall and charge the market participant for the services
provided.
(c) Day-ahead energy market. ERCOT shall operate a voluntary day-ahead energy market, either directly or
through contract.
(d) Adequacy of operational information. ERCOT shall require resource-specific bid curves for energy and
ancillary capacity services that it competitively procures in the day-ahead or operating day, and ERCOT shall
use these bid curves or ex-ante mitigated bid curves to address market failure, as appropriate, in its operational
decisions and financial settlements.
(e) Congestion pricing.
(1) ERCOT shall directly assign all congestion rents to those resources that caused the congestion.
(2) ERCOT shall be considered to have complied with paragraph (1) of this subsection if it complies
with this paragraph. ERCOT shall settle each resource imbalance at its nodal locational marginal
price (LMP) calculated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section; each load imbalance at its zonal
price calculated pursuant to subsection (h) of this section; and congestion rents on each scheduled
transaction for a resource and load pair at the difference between the nodal LMP at the resource
injection location calculated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and the zonal price at the load
withdrawal location calculated pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.
(f) Nodal energy prices for resources. ERCOT shall use nodal energy prices for resources. Nodal energy
prices for resources shall be the locational marginal prices, consistent with subsection (e) of this section,
resulting from security-constrained, economic dispatch.
(g) Energy trading hubs. ERCOT shall provide information for energy trading hubs by aggregating nodes and
calculating an average price for each aggregation, for each financial settlement interval.
(h) Zonal energy prices for loads. ERCOT shall use zonal energy prices for loads that consist of an aggregation
of either the individual load node energy prices within each zone or the individual resource node energy
prices within each zone. Individual load node or resource node energy prices shall be the locational marginal
prices, consistent with subsection (e) of this section, resulting from security-constrained, economic dispatch.
ERCOT shall maintain stable zones and shall notify market participants in advance of zonal boundary
changes in order that the market participants will have an appropriate amount of time to adjust to the changes.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.501--2 effective date 4/18/12
(P 39917)
(i) Congestion rights. ERCOT shall provide congestion revenue rights (CRRs), but shall not provide physical
transmission rights. ERCOT shall auction all CRRs, using a simultaneous combinatorial auction, except as
otherwise ordered by the commission for any preassigned CRRs approved by the commission. CRRs shall
not be subject to “use-it-or-lose-it” or “schedule-it-or-lose-it” restrictions and shall be tradable.
(j) Pricing safeguards. ERCOT shall apply pricing safeguards to protect against market failure, including
market power abuse, consistent with direction provided by the commission.
(k) Simultaneous optimization of ancillary capacity services. For ancillary capacity services that it
competitively procures in the day-ahead or operating day, ERCOT shall use simultaneous optimization and
shall set prices for each service to the corresponding shadow price.
(l) Multi-settlement system for procuring energy and ancillary capacity services. For any energy and
ancillary capacity services that it competitively procures in the day-ahead or operating day, ERCOT shall set
a separate market clearing price for each procurement of a particular service.
(m) Energy Storage.
(1) For a storage facility that has more than one delivery point, ERCOT shall net the impact of those
delivery points on the ERCOT system for settlement purposes.
(2) Wholesale storage occurs when electricity is used to charge a storage facility; the storage facility is
separately metered from all other facilities including auxiliary facilities; and energy from the
electricity is stored in the storage facility and subsequently re-generated and sold at wholesale as
energy or ancillary services. Wholesale storage is wholesale load and ERCOT shall settle it
accordingly, except that ERCOT shall settle wholesale storage using the nodal energy price at the
electrical bus that connects the storage facility to the transmission system, or if the storage facility
is connected at distribution voltage, the nodal price of the nearest electrical bus that connects to the
transmission system. Wholesale storage is not subject to retail tariffs, rates, and charges or fees
assessed in conjunction with the retail purchase of electricity. Wholesale storage shall not be subject
to ERCOT charges and credits associated with ancillary service obligations, or other load ratio share
or per megawatt-hour based charges and allocations. The owner or operator of electric storage
equipment or facilities shall not make purchases of electricity for storage during a system emergency
declared by ERCOT unless ERCOT directs that such purchases occur.

§25.502--1 effective 12/5/19
(P 49788)
§25.502. Pricing Safeguards in Markets Operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the public from harm when wholesale electricity prices in
markets operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in the ERCOT power region are not
determined by the normal forces of competition.
(b) Applicability. This section applies to any entity, either acting alone or in cooperation with others, that buys
or sells at wholesale energy, capacity, or any other wholesale electric service in a market operated by ERCOT
in the ERCOT power region; any agent that represents such an entity in such activities; and ERCOT. This
section does not limit the commission’s authority to ensure reasonable ancillary energy and capacity service
prices and to address market power abuse.
(c) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings, unless the
context indicates otherwise.
(1) Competitive constraint -- A transmission element on which prices to relieve congestion are
moderated by the normal forces of competition between multiple, unaffiliated resources.
(2) Generation entity -- An entity that owns or controls a generation resource.
(3) Market location -- The location for purposes of financial settlement of a service (e.g., congestion
management zone in a zonal market design or a node in a nodal market design).
(4) Must-run alternative (MRA) service -- A service that ERCOT may procure as an alternative to
reliability must-run service.
(5) Noncompetitive constraint -- A transmission element on which prices to relieve congestion are not
moderated by the normal forces of competition between multiple, unaffiliated resources.
(6) Reliability must-run (RMR) service -- A service provided by a generation resource to meet a
reliability need resulting from the planned suspension of operation of that generation resource for a
period of greater than 180 calendar days.
(7) Resource -- A generation resource, or a load capable of complying with ERCOT instructions to
reduce or increase the need for electrical energy or to provide an ancillary service (i.e., a “load acting
as a resource”).
(8) Resource entity -- An entity that owns or controls a resource.
(9) Suspension date -- The date specified by a generation entity in a notice to ERCOT as the date on
which it intends to suspend operation of a generation resource for a period of greater than 180
calendar days.
(d) Control of resources. Each resource entity must inform ERCOT as to each resource that it controls, and
provide proof that is sufficient for ERCOT to verify control. In addition, the resource entity must notify
ERCOT of any change in control of a resource that it controls no later than 14 calendar days prior to the date
that the change in control takes effect, or as soon as possible in a situation where the resource entity cannot
meet the 14 calendar day notice requirement. For purposes of this section, “control” means ultimate decisionmaking authority over how a resource is dispatched and priced, either by virtue of ownership or agreement,
and a substantial financial stake in the resource’s profitable operation. If a resource is jointly controlled, the
resource entities must inform ERCOT of any right to use an identified portion of the capacity of the resource.
Resources under common control will be considered affiliated.
(e) RMR resources. Except for the occurrence of a forced outage, a generation entity must submit to ERCOT
in writing a notice of suspension of operation no later than 150 calendar days prior to the suspension date. If
a generation resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis in accordance with ERCOT protocols, the
generation entity must submit in writing a notice of suspension of operation no later than 90 calendar days
prior to the suspension date. ERCOT must issue a final determination of the need for RMR service within 60
calendar days of ERCOT’s receipt of the notice. If ERCOT determines that the generation resource is not
needed for RMR service, the generation entity may suspend operation of the generation resource before the
suspension date, subject to ERCOT approval. Unless ERCOT has determined that a generation entity’s
generation resource is not required for ERCOT reliability, determined that the resource is needed for 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.502--2 effective 12/5/19
(P 49788)
reliability but is not a cost-effective solution to the reliability concern, or entered into an MRA service
agreement as an alternative to an RMR service agreement, the generation entity must not terminate its
registration of the generation resource with ERCOT unless it has transferred the generation resource to a
generation entity that has a current resource-entity agreement with ERCOT and the transferee registers that
generation resource with ERCOT at the time of the transfer.
(1) Complaint with the commission. If, by the suspension date, ERCOT has not notified the
generation entity that the continued operation of the generation resource is not required for reliability
or is not a cost-effective solution to the reliability need, and has not entered into an RMR service
agreement with the generation entity for the generation resource or an MRA service agreement as
an alternative to an RMR service agreement, then the generation entity may file a complaint with
the commission against ERCOT, under §22.251 of this title (relating to Review of Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) conduct).
(A) The generation entity will have the burden of proof.
(B) As required by §22.251(d) of this title, absent a showing of good cause to the commission
to justify a later deadline, the generation entity’s deadline to file the complaint is 35
calendar days after the suspension date.
(C) The dispute underlying the complaint is not subject to ERCOT’s alternative dispute
resolution procedures.
(D) In its complaint, the generation entity may request interim relief under §22.125 of this title
(relating to Interim Relief), an expedited procedural schedule, and identify any special
circumstances pertaining to the generation resource at issue.
(E) As required by §22.251(f) of this title, ERCOT must file a response to the generation
entity’s complaint and must include as part of the response all existing, non-privileged
documents that support ERCOT’s position on the issues identified by the generation entity
as required by §22.251(d)(1)(C) of this title.
(F) The scope of the complaint may include the need for the RMR service; the reasonable
compensation and other terms for the RMR service; the length of the RMR service,
including any appropriate RMR exit options; and any other issue pertaining to the RMR
service.
(G) Any compensation ordered by the commission will be effective the first calendar day after
the suspension date. If there is a pre-existing RMR service agreement concerning the
generation resource, the compensation ordered by the commission will not become
effective until the termination of the pre-existing agreement, unless the commission finds
that the pre-existing RMR service agreement is not in the public interest.
(H) If the generation entity does not file a complaint with the commission, the generation entity
will be deemed to have accepted ERCOT’s most-recent offer as of the suspension date.
(2) Out-of-merit-order dispatch. The generation entity must maintain the generation resource so that
it is available for out-of-merit-order dispatch instruction by ERCOT until:
(A) ERCOT determines that the generation resource is not required for ERCOT reliability;
(B) any RMR service agreement takes effect;
(C) the commission determines that the generation resource is not required for ERCOT
reliability; or
(D) a commission order requiring the generation entity to provide RMR service takes effect.
(3) RMR exit strategy. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission, the implementation of an RMR
exit strategy in conformance with the ERCOT Protocols is not affected by the filing of a complaint
under this subsection.
(4) Evaluation of RMR and MRA service. ERCOT may decline to enter into an RMR or MRA service
agreement based on an evaluation that considers the costs and benefits of the RMR or MRA service,
subject to the requirements of paragraph (5) of this subsection. ERCOT may enter into an MRA
service agreement if it identifies a resource or group of resources that will address a reliability need
resulting from a planned suspension of operation of a generation resource in a more cost-effective
manner than entering into an RMR service agreement, subject to the requirements of paragraph (5)
of this subsection. ERCOT may incorporate the economic value of lost load into its evaluation.

§25.502--3 effective 12/5/19
(P 49788)
(5) Approval of RMR and MRA service agreements. All recommendations by ERCOT staff to enter
into an RMR or MRA service agreement will be subject to approval by the ERCOT governing board.
If ERCOT identifies a reliability need for RMR or MRA service but recommends against entering
into an RMR or MRA service agreement, ERCOT staff’s recommendation will be subject to
approval by the ERCOT governing board. In its request for governing board approval, ERCOT staff
must present information that justifies its recommendation.
(6) Refund of payments for capital expenditures. A resource entity that owns or controls a resource
providing RMR or MRA service must refund payments for capital expenditures made by ERCOT
in connection with the RMR or MRA service agreement if the resource participates in the energy or
ancillary service markets at any time following the termination of the agreement. ERCOT may
require less than the entire original amount of capital expenditures to be refunded to reflect the
depreciation of capital over time.
(7) Implementation. ERCOT, through its stakeholder process, must establish protocols and procedures
to implement this subsection.
(f) Noncompetitive constraints. ERCOT, through its stakeholder process, must develop protocols to mitigate
the price effects of congestion on noncompetitive constraints.
(1) The protocols must specify a method by which noncompetitive constraints may be distinguished
from competitive constraints.
(2) Competitive constraints and noncompetitive constraints must be designated annually prior to the
corresponding auction of annual congestion revenue rights. A constraint may be redesignated on an
interim basis.
(3) The protocols must be designed to ensure that a noncompetitive constraint will not be treated as a
competitive constraint.

§25.503. Oversight of Wholesale Market Participants.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the standards that the commission will apply in
monitoring the activities of entities participating in the wholesale electricity markets, including markets
administered by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and enforcing the Public Utility
Regulatory Act (PURA) and ERCOT procedures relating to wholesale markets. The standards contained in
this rule are necessary to:
(1) protect customers from unfair, misleading, and deceptive practices in the wholesale markets,
including ERCOT-administered markets;
(2) ensure that ancillary services necessary to facilitate the reliable transmission of electric energy are
available at reasonable prices;
(3) afford customers safe, reliable, and reasonably priced electricity;
(4) ensure that all wholesale market participants observe all scheduling, operating, reliability, and
settlement policies, rules, guidelines, and procedures established in the ERCOT procedures;
(5) clarify prohibited activities in the wholesale markets, including ERCOT-administered markets;
(6) monitor and mitigate market power as authorized by the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)
§39.157(a) and prevent market power abuses;
(7) clarify the standards and criteria the commission will use when reviewing wholesale market
activities;
(8) clarify the remedies for non-compliance with the Protocols relating to wholesale markets; and
(9) prescribe ERCOT’s role in enforcing ERCOT procedures relating to the reliability of the regional
electric network and accounting for the production and delivery among generators and all other
market participants and monitoring and obtaining compliance with operating standards within the
ERCOT regional network.
(b) Application. This section applies to all market entities, as defined in subsection (c) of this section.
(c) Definitions. The following words and terms when used in this section have the following meaning, unless
the context indicates otherwise:
(1) Artificial congestion -- Congestion created when multiple foreseeable options exist for scheduling,
dispatching, or operating a resource, and a market participant chooses an option that is not the most
economical, that foreseeably creates or exacerbates transmission congestion, and that results in the
market participant being paid to relieve the congestion it caused.
(2) Efficient operation of the market -- Operation of the markets administered by ERCOT, consistent
with reliability standards, that is characterized by the fullest use of competitive auctions to procure
ancillary services, minimal cost socialization, and the most economical utilization of resources,
subject to necessary operational and other constraints.
(3) ERCOT procedures -- Documents that contain the scheduling, operating, planning, reliability, and
settlement procedures, standards, and criteria that are public and in effect in the ERCOT power
region, including the ERCOT Protocols, ERCOT Operating Guides, and Other Binding Documents
as amended from time to time but excluding ERCOT’s internal administrative procedures. The
Protocols generally govern when there are inconsistencies between the Protocols and the Operating
Guides, except when ERCOT staff, consistent with subsection (i) of this section, determines that a
provision contained in the Operating Guides is technically superior for the efficient and reliable
operation of the electric network.
(4) Excess Revenue -- Revenue in excess of the revenue that would have occurred absent a violation
of PURA §39.157 or this section.
(5) Market entity -- Any person or entity participating in the ERCOT-administered wholesale market,
including, but not limited to, a load serving entity (including a municipally owned utility and an
electric cooperative,) a power marketer, a transmission and distribution utility, a power generation
company, a qualifying facility, an exempt wholesale generator, ERCOT, and any entity conducting

(6) Market participant -- A market entity other than ERCOT.
(7) Reliability Monitor -- A person or entity selected by the commission to monitor compliance with
all state reliability-related laws, rules, and ERCOT procedures including protocols, processes and
any other operating standards applicable to the ERCOT Region.
(8) Resource -- Facilities capable of providing electrical energy or load capable of reducing or
increasing the need for electrical energy or providing short-term reserves into the ERCOT system.
This includes generation and load resources.
(d) Standards and criteria for enforcement of ERCOT procedures and PURA. The commission will monitor
the activities of market entities to determine if such activities are consistent with ERCOT procedures; whether
they constitute market power abuses or are unfair, misleading, or deceptive practices affecting customers; and
whether they are consistent with the proper accounting for the production and delivery of electricity among
generators and other market participants. When reviewing the activities of a market entity, the commission
will consider whether the activity was conducted in a manner that:
(1) adversely affected customers in a material way through the use of unfair, misleading, or deceptive
practices;
(2) materially reduced the competitiveness of the market, including whether the activity unfairly
impacted other market participants in a way that restricts competition;
(3) disregarded its effect on the reliability of the ERCOT electric system; or
(4) interfered with the efficient operation of the market.
(e) Guiding ethical standards. Each market participant is expected to:
(1) observe all applicable laws and rules;
(2) schedule, bid, and operate its resources in a manner consistent with ERCOT procedures to support
the efficient and reliable operation of the ERCOT electric system; and
(3) not engage in activities and transactions that create artificial congestion or artificial supply
shortages, artificially inflate revenues or volumes, or manipulate the market or market prices in any
way.
(f) Duties of market entities.
(1) Each market participant must be knowledgeable about ERCOT procedures.
(2) A market participant must comply with ERCOT procedures and any official interpretation of the
Protocols issued by ERCOT or the commission.
(A) If a market participant disagrees with any provision of the Protocols or any official
interpretation of the Protocols, it may seek an amendment of the Protocols as provided for
in the Protocols, appeal an ERCOT official interpretation to the commission, or both.
(B) A market participant appealing an official interpretation of the Protocols or seeking an
amendment to the Protocols must comply with the Protocols unless and until the
interpretation is officially changed or the amendment is officially adopted.
(C) A market participant may be excused from compliance with ERCOT instructions or
Protocol requirements only if such non-compliance is due to communication or equipment
failure beyond the reasonable control of the market participant; if compliance would
jeopardize public health and safety or the reliability of the ERCOT transmission grid, or
create risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment; if compliance would be inconsistent
with facility licensing, environmental, or legal requirements; if required by applicable law;
or for other good cause. A market participant is excused under this subparagraph only for
so long as the condition continues.
(3) Whenever the Protocols require that a market participant make its “best effort” or a “good faith
effort” to meet a requirement, or similar language, the market participant must act in accordance
with the requirement unless:
(A) it is not technically possible to do so; 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.503--3 effective date 03/04/21
(P 50602)
(B) doing so would jeopardize public health and safety or the reliability of the ERCOT
transmission grid, or would create a risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment;
(C) doing so would be inconsistent with facility licensing, environmental, or legal
requirements; or
(D) other good cause exists for excusing the requirement.
(4) When a market participant is not able to comply with a Protocol requirement or official
interpretation of a requirement, or honor a formal commitment to ERCOT, the market participant
has an obligation to notify ERCOT immediately upon learning of such constraints and to notify
ERCOT when the problem ceases. A market participant who does not comply with a Protocol
requirement or official interpretation of a requirement, or honor a formal commitment to ERCOT,
has the burden to demonstrate, in any commission proceeding in which the failure to comply is
raised, why it cannot comply with the Protocol requirement or official interpretation of the
requirement, or honor the commitment.
(5) The commission staff may request information from a market participant concerning a notification
of failure to comply with a Protocol requirement or official interpretation of a requirement, or honor
a formal commitment to ERCOT. The market participant must provide a response that is detailed
and reasonably complete, explaining the circumstances surrounding the alleged failure, and must
provide documents and other materials relating to such alleged failure to comply. The response must
be submitted to the commission staff within five business days of a written request for information,
unless commission staff agrees to an extension.
(6) A market participant’s bids of energy and ancillary services must be from resources that are
available and capable of performing, and must be feasible within the limits of the operating
characteristics indicated in the resource plan, as defined in the Protocols, and consistent with the
applicable ramp rate, as specified in the Protocols.
(7) All statements, data and information provided by a market participant to market publications and
publishers of surveys and market indices for the computation of an industry price index must be
true, accurate, reasonably complete, and must be consistent with the market participant’s activities,
subject to generally accepted standards of confidentiality and industry standards. Market
participants must exercise due diligence to prevent the release of materially inaccurate or misleading
information.
(8) A market entity has an obligation to provide accurate and factual information and must not submit
false or misleading information, or omit material information, in any communication with ERCOT
or with the commission. Market entities must exercise due diligence to ensure adherence to this
provision throughout the entity.
(9) A market participant must comply with all reporting requirements governing the availability and
maintenance of a generating unit or transmission facility, including outage scheduling reporting
requirements. A market participant must immediately notify ERCOT when capacity changes or
resource limitations occur that materially affect the availability of a unit or facility, the anticipated
operation of its resources, or the ability to comply with ERCOT dispatch instructions.
(10) A market participant must comply with requests for information or data by ERCOT as specified by
the Protocols or ERCOT instructions within the time specified by ERCOT instructions, or such other
time agreed to by ERCOT and the market participant.
(11) When a Protocol provision or its applicability is unclear, or when a situation arises that is not
contemplated under the Protocols, a market entity seeking clarification of the Protocols must use
the Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) process provided in the Protocols. If the NPRR
process is impractical or inappropriate under the circumstances, the market entity may use the
process for requesting formal Protocol clarifications or interpretations described in subsection (i) of
this section. This provision is not intended to discourage day to day informal communication
between market participants and ERCOT staff.
(12) A market participant operating in the ERCOT markets or a member of the ERCOT staff who
identifies a provision in the ERCOT procedures that produces an outcome inconsistent with the
efficient and reliable operation of the ERCOT-administered markets must call the provision to the
attention of ERCOT staff and the appropriate ERCOT subcommittee. All market participants must 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.503--4 effective date 03/04/21
(P 50602)
cooperate with the ERCOT subcommittees, ERCOT staff, and the commission staff to develop
Protocols that are clear and consistent.
(13) A market participant must establish and document internal procedures that instruct its affected
personnel on how to implement ERCOT procedures according to the standards delineated in this
section. Each market participant must establish clear lines of accountability for its market practices.
(g) Prohibited activities. Any act or practice of a market participant that materially and adversely affects the
reliability of the regional electric network or the proper accounting for the production and delivery of
electricity among market participants is considered a “prohibited activity.” The term “prohibited activity” in
this subsection excludes acts or practices expressly allowed by the Protocols or by official interpretations of
the Protocols and acts or practices conducted in compliance with express directions from ERCOT or
commission rule or order or other legal authority. The term “prohibited activity” includes, but is not limited
to, the following acts and practices that have been found to cause prices that are not reflective of competitive
market forces or to adversely affect the reliability of the electric network:
(1) A market participant must not schedule, operate, or dispatch its generating units in a way that creates
artificial congestion.
(2) A market participant must not execute pre-arranged offsetting trades of the same product among the
same parties, or through third party arrangements, which involve no economic risk and no material
net change in beneficial ownership.
(3) A market participant must not offer reliability products to the market that cannot or will not be
provided if selected.
(4) A market participant must not conduct trades that result in a misrepresentation of the financial
condition of the organization.
(5) A market participant must not engage in fraudulent behavior related to its participation in the
wholesale market.
(6) A market participant must not collude with other market participants to manipulate the price or
supply of power, allocate territories, customers or products, or otherwise unlawfully restrain
competition. This provision should be interpreted in accordance with federal and state antitrust
statutes and judicially-developed standards under such statutes regarding collusion.
(7) A market participant must not engage in market power abuse. Withholding of production, whether
economic withholding or physical withholding, by a market participant who has market power,
constitutes an abuse of market power.
(h) Defenses. The term “prohibited activity” in subsection (g) of this section excludes acts or practices that would
otherwise be included, if the market entity establishes that its conduct served a legitimate business purpose
consistent with prices set by competitive market forces; and that it did not know, and could not reasonably
anticipate, that its actions would inflate prices, adversely affect the reliability of the regional electric network,
or adversely affect the proper accounting for the production and delivery of electricity; or, if applicable, that
it exercised due diligence to prevent the excluded act or practice. The defenses established in this subsection
may also be asserted in instances in which a market participant is alleged to have violated subsection (f) of
this section. A market entity claiming an exclusion or defense under this subsection, or any other type of
affirmative defense, has the burden of proof to establish all of the elements of such exclusion or defense.
(i) Official interpretations and clarifications regarding the Protocols. A market entity seeking an
interpretation or clarification of the Protocols must use the NPRR process contained in the Protocols
whenever possible. If an interpretation or clarification is needed to address an unforeseen situation and there
is not sufficient time to submit the issue to the NPRR process, a market entity may seek an official Protocol
interpretation or clarification from ERCOT in accordance with this subsection.
(1) ERCOT must develop a process for formally addressing requests for clarification of the Protocols
submitted by market participants or issuing official interpretations regarding the application of
Protocol provisions and requirements. ERCOT must respond to the requestor within ten business
days of ERCOT’s receipt of the request for interpretation or clarification with either an official 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.503--5 effective date 03/04/21
(P 50602)
Protocol interpretation or a recommendation that the requestor take the request through the NPRR
process.
(2) ERCOT must designate one or more ERCOT officials who will be authorized to receive requests
for clarification from, and issue responses to market participants, and to issue official interpretations
on behalf of ERCOT regarding the application of Protocol provisions and requirements.
(3) The designated ERCOT official must provide a copy of the clarification request to commission staff
upon receipt. The ERCOT official must consult with ERCOT operational or legal staff as
appropriate and with commission staff before issuing an official Protocol clarification or
interpretation.
(4) The designated ERCOT official may decide, in consultation with the commission staff, that the
language for which a clarification is requested is ambiguous or for other reason beyond ERCOT’s
ability to clarify, in which case the ERCOT official shall inform the requestor, who may take the
request through the NPRR process provided for in the Protocols.
(5) All official Protocol clarifications or interpretations that ERCOT issues in response to a market
participant’s formal request or upon ERCOT’s own initiative must be sent out in a market bulletin
with the appropriate effective date specified to inform all market participants, and a copy of the
clarification or interpretation must be maintained in a manner that is accessible to market
participants. Such response must not contain information that would identify the requesting market
participant.
(6) A market participant may freely communicate informally with ERCOT employees, however, the
opinion of an individual ERCOT staff member not issued as an official interpretation of ERCOT
pursuant to this subsection may not be relied upon as an affirmative defense by a market participant.
(j) Role of ERCOT in enforcing operating standards. ERCOT must monitor material occurrences of noncompliance with ERCOT procedures, which means occurrences that have the potential to impede ERCOT
operations or represent a risk to system reliability. Non-compliance indicators monitored by ERCOT must
include, but are not limited to, material occurrences of failing resource performance measures as established
by ERCOT, failure to follow dispatch instructions within the required time, failure to meet ancillary services
obligations, failure to submit mandatory bids or offers, and other instances of non-compliance of a similar
magnitude.
(1) ERCOT must keep a record of all such material occurrences of non-compliance with ERCOT
procedures and must develop a system for tracking recurrence of such material occurrences of noncompliance.
(2) ERCOT must promptly provide information to and respond to questions from market participants
to allow the market participant to understand and respond to alleged material occurrences of noncompliance with ERCOT procedures. However, this requirement does not relieve the market
participant’s operator from responding to the ERCOT operator’s instruction in a timely manner and
shall not be interpreted as allowing the market participant’s operator to argue with the ERCOT
operator as to the need for compliance.
(3) ERCOT must keep a record of the resolution of such material occurrences of non-compliance and
of remedial actions taken by the market participant in each instance.
(4) ERCOT must promptly provide information to and respond to questions posed by the Reliability
Monitor and the commission.
(5) ERCOT must provide to the Reliability Monitor and the commission the support and cooperation
the commission determines is necessary for the Reliability Monitor and the commission to perform
their functions.
(6) If directed by the commission, ERCOT must assume all or part of the duties and responsibilities of
the Reliability Monitor under (k). ERCOT must assume these duties and responsibilities, including
establishing appropriate safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure the independence and
objectivity of ERCOT personnel with respect to the duties and responsibilities assumed, in the
manner prescribed by the commission.

PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.503--6 effective date 03/04/21
(P 50602)
(k) Responsibilities of the Reliability Monitor. The Reliability Monitor must gather and analyze information
and data as needed for its reliability monitoring activities. The Reliability Monitor works under the direction
and supervision of the commission. The Reliability Monitor must protect confidential information and data
in accordance with the confidentiality standards established in PURA, the ERCOT protocols, commission
rules, and other applicable laws. The requirements related to the level of protection to be afforded
information protected by these laws and rules are incorporated into this section. The duties and
responsibilities of the Reliability Monitor may include, but are not limited to:
(1) Monitoring, investigating, auditing, and reporting to the commission regarding compliance with
reliability-related ERCOT procedures, including Protocols, Operating Guides, and Other Binding
Documents, the reliability-related provisions of the commission’s rules, and reliability-related
provisions of PURA by market entities;
(2) Providing reliability-related subject-matter advice, expertise, and assistance to the commission in
the conduct of the commission’s oversight and enforcement activities; and
(3) Providing expert advice, analysis, reports, and testimony services relating to the Reliability
Monitor’s analysis and findings as part of the commission staff’s case in enforcement proceedings.
(l) Selection of the Reliability Monitor. The commission may select an entity to act as the Reliability Monitor.
If the commission selects an entity other than ERCOT to act as the Reliability Monitor, the Reliability
Monitor must be independent from ERCOT and is not subject to the supervision of ERCOT with respect to
its monitoring and investigative activities. If the commission selects an entity other than ERCOT to act as
the Reliability Monitor, the commission and ERCOT will enter into a contract with the selected entity. In
selecting the Reliability Monitor, the commission must consider whether the Reliability Monitor satisfies the
following criteria:
(1) Independence, objectivity, and the absence of potential conflicts of interest;
(2) Experience performing compliance monitoring of reliability-related laws;
(3) Familiarity with the ERCOT Region and understanding of reliability-related ERCOT protocols,
procedures, and other operating standards;
(4) Ability to manage confidential information appropriately; and
(5) Cost effectiveness.
(m) Funding of the Reliability Monitor. ERCOT must fund the operations of the Reliability Monitor from the
fee authorized by PURA §39.151.
(n) Standards for record keeping.
(1) A market participant who schedules through a qualified scheduling entity (QSE) that submits
schedules to ERCOT on behalf of more than one market participants must maintain records to show
scheduling, offer, and bidding information for all schedules, offers, and bids that its QSE has
submitted to ERCOT on its behalf, by interval.
(2) All market participants and ERCOT must maintain records relative to market participants’ activities
in the ERCOT-administered markets to show:
(A) information on transactions, as defined in §25.93(c)(3) of this title (relating to Quarterly
Wholesale Electricity Transaction Reports), including the date, type of transaction, amount
of transaction, and entities involved;
(B) information and documentation of all planned, maintenance, and forced generation and
transmission outages including all documentation necessary to document the reason for the
outage;

(P 50602)
(D) reports of the market participant’s financial information given to external parties, including
the date, financial results reported, and the party to whom financial information was
reported, if applicable.
(3) After the effective date of this section, all records referred to in this subsection except verbal
dispatch instructions (VDIs) must be kept for a minimum of three years from the date of the event.
ERCOT must keep VDI records for a minimum of two years. All records must be made available to
the commission for inspection upon request.
(4) A market participant must, upon request from the commission, provide the information referred to
in this subsection to the commission, and may, if applicable, provide it under a confidentiality
agreement or protective order pursuant to §22.71(d) of this title (relating to Filing of Pleadings,
Documents, and Other Material).
(o) Investigation. The commission staff may initiate an informal fact-finding review based on a complaint or
upon its own initiative to obtain information regarding facts, conditions, practices, or matters that it may find
necessary or proper to ascertain in order to evaluate whether any market entity has violated any provision of
this section.
(1) The commission staff will contact the market entity whose activities are in question to provide the
market entity an opportunity to explain its activities. The commission staff may require the market
entity to provide information reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this subsection.
(2) If the market entity asserts that the information requested by commission staff is confidential, the
information must be provided to commission staff as confidential information related to settlement
negotiations or other asserted bases for confidentiality pursuant to §22.71(d)(4) of this title.
(3) If after conducting its fact-finding review, the commission staff determines that a market entity may
have violated this section, the commission staff may request that the commission initiate a formal
investigation against the market entity pursuant to §22.241 of this title (relating to Investigations).
(4) If, as a result of its investigation, commission staff determines that there is evidence of a violation
of this section by a market entity, the commission staff may request that the commission initiate
appropriate enforcement action against the market entity. A notice of violation requesting
administrative penalties or disgorgement of excess revenues must comply with the requirements of
§22.246 of this title (relating to Administrative Penalties). Adjudication of a notice of violation
requesting both an administrative penalty and disgorgement of excess revenues may be conducted
within a single contested case proceeding. Additionally, for alleged violations that have been
reviewed in the informal procedure established by this subsection, the commission staff must
include as part of its prima facie case:
(A) a statement either that –
(i) the commission staff has conducted the investigation allowed by this section; or
(ii) the market entity has failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (5) of
this subsection;
(B) a summary of the evidence indicating to the commission staff that the market entity has
violated one of the provisions of this section;
(C) a summary of any evidence indicating to the commission staff that the market entity
benefited from the alleged violation or materially harmed the market; and
(D) a statement that the staff has concluded that the market entity failed to demonstrate, in the
course of the investigation, the applicability of an exclusion or affirmative defense under
subsection (h) of this section.
(5) A market entity subject to an informal fact-finding review or a formal investigation by the
commission staff has an obligation to fully cooperate with the investigation, to make its company
representatives available within a reasonable period of time to discuss the subject of the
investigation with the commission staff, and to respond to the commission staff’s requests for
information within a reasonable time frame as requested by the commission staff.
(6) The procedure for informal fact-finding review established in this subsection does not prevent any
person or commission staff from filing a formal complaint with the commission pursuant to §22.242
of this title (relating to Complaints) or pursuing other relief available by law.

§25.504--1 effective date 5/15/2024
(P-55948)
§25.504. Wholesale Market Power in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Power Region.
(a) Application. This section applies to all generation entities in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
(ERCOT). This section defines the term “market power,” as that term is used in §25.503 of this title (relating
to Oversight of Wholesale Market Participants).
(b) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings, unless the
context or specific language of a section indicates otherwise:
(1) Generation entity -- An entity that controls a generation resource. An entity affiliated with a
generation entity shall be considered part of that generation entity.
(2) Market power -- The ability to control prices or exclude competition in a relevant market.
(3) Market power abuse -- Practices by persons possessing market power that are unreasonably
discriminatory or tend to unreasonably restrict, impair, or reduce the level of competition, including
practices that tie unregulated products or services to regulated products or services or unreasonably
discriminate in the provision of regulated services. Market power abuses include predatory pricing,
withholding of production, precluding entry, and collusion.
(c) Exemption based on installed generation capacity. A single generation entity that controls less than 5%
of the installed generation capacity in ERCOT, as the term “installed generation capacity” is defined in §25.5
of this title (relating to Definitions), excluding uncontrollable renewable resources, is deemed not to have
ERCOT-wide market power. Controlling 5% or more of the installed generation capacity in ERCOT does
not, of itself, mean that a generating entity has market power.
(d) Withholding of production. Prices offered by a generation entity with market power may be a factor in
determining whether the entity has withheld production. A generation entity with market power that prices
its services substantially above its marginal cost may be found to be withholding production; offering prices
that are not substantially above marginal cost does not constitute withholding of production.
(e) Voluntary mitigation plan. Any generation entity may submit to the commission a voluntary mitigation
plan relating to compliance with §25.503(g)(7) of this title or with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)
§39.157(a). Adherence to a commission-approved voluntary mitigation plan must be considered in a
proceeding to determine whether the generation entity violated PURA §39.157 or §25.503(g)(7) of this title
and, if so, the amount of the administrative penalty to be assessed for the violation.
(1) The commission will approve the voluntary mitigation plan only if it finds that the plan is in the
public interest.
(2) A generation entity or commission staff may apply to amend a voluntary mitigation plan that applies
to the generation entity.
(3) The parties to a proceeding related to the approval or amendment of a voluntary mitigation plan are
limited to the generation entity applying for the mitigation plan, commission staff, and the
independent market monitor.
(4) Termination of voluntary mitigation plan.
(A) The commission, on its own motion, may terminate, in whole or in part, a voluntary
mitigation plan approved under this subsection. The executive director or the executive
director’s designee may also terminate a voluntary mitigation plan, in whole or in part,
under the following conditions:
(i) The executive director or the executive director’s designee must determine that
continuation of the plan is no longer in the public interest.
(ii) The executive director or the executive director’s designee must provide notice of
the termination to the applicable generation entity and file a notice of termination
in the same control number in which the plan was approved at least three working
days prior to the effective date of the termination. The executive director or the
executive director’s designee may withdraw the notice of termination at any point
prior to the effective date of the termination.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.504--2 effective date 5/15/2024
(P-55948)
(iii) The commission must affirm or set aside the executive director or the executive
director’s designee’s termination of a voluntary mitigation plan as soon as
practicable after the effective date of the termination.
(B) A generation entity with a commission-approved voluntary mitigation plan may terminate
the plan. The generation entity must provide the executive director or executive director’s
designee notice of the termination and file a notice of termination in the same control
number in which the plan was approved at least three working days prior to the effective
date of the termination. The generation entity may withdraw its notice of termination at
any point prior to the effective date of the termination.
(f) Review of voluntary mitigation plans.
(1) The commission will review each effective voluntary mitigation plan adopted under subsection (e)
of this section to determine whether the plan remains in the public interest at least once every two
years and not later than 90 days after the implementation date of a wholesale market design change.
Commission staff, in consultation with the independent market monitor, will determine when a
wholesale market design change requiring the review of voluntary mitigation plans has occurred.
(A) In determining whether a change in a commission or ERCOT regulation constitutes a
wholesale market design change for purposes of this subsection, commission staff and the
independent market monitor must consider whether the change could materially increase
the ability of a generation entity with an existing voluntary mitigation plan to exercise
market power.
(B) If, at the time a proposed change in a commission or ERCOT regulation is being considered
for approval by the commission, commission staff has determined that the proposed change
would, if implemented, constitute a wholesale market design change, commission staff
may include its determination in a filing addressing the proposed change (e.g., as part of a
staff memo recommending commission approval of a change in the ERCOT protocols).
(C) Commission staff must provide notice, using a reasonable method of notice, to a generation
entity with an existing voluntary mitigation plan when its voluntary mitigation plan is under
review. This notice must be provided no later than the date commission staff files its
recommendation under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(D) Nothing in this paragraph prevents the commission, on its own motion, from determining
that a change in a commission or ERCOT regulation constitutes a wholesale market design
change for purposes of this subsection and directing commission staff, in consultation with
the independent market monitor, to provide a recommendation on whether each existing
voluntary mitigation plan remains in the public interest.
(2) At least 40 days prior to a deadline established by paragraph (1) of this subsection, commission staff
must file a recommendation and draft order addressing whether each voluntary mitigation plan
remains in the public interest. Commission staff’s recommendation must include the date of the
deadline established by paragraph (1) of this subsection and, if applicable, the details and
implementation date of the applicable wholesale market design change. As part of its
recommendation, for each voluntary mitigation plan adopted prior to September 1, 2023,
commission staff must also address whether the plan complies with PURA §15.023(f) and this
section.
(3) If the commission determines that all or a part of the plan is no longer in the public interest, the
commission will terminate any part of the plan that it determines is no longer in the public interest.
The generation entity may propose an amended plan for the commission’s consideration.

that projects, for at least the next five years, the capability of existing and planned electric generation
resources and load resources to reliably meet the projected system demand in the ERCOT power region.
ERCOT may publish other resource adequacy reports or forecasts as it deems appropriate. ERCOT must
prescribe requirements for generation entities and transmission service providers (TSPs) to report their plans
for adding new facilities, upgrading existing facilities, and mothballing or retiring existing facilities. ERCOT
also must prescribe requirements for load entities to report their plans for adding new load resources or
retiring existing load resources.
(c) Daily assessment of system adequacy. Each day, ERCOT must publish a report that includes the following
information for each hour for the seven days beginning with the day the report is published:
(1) system-wide load forecast; and
(2) aggregated information on the availability of resources, by ERCOT load zone, including load
resources.
(d) Filing of resource and transmission information with ERCOT. ERCOT must prescribe reporting
requirements for resource entities and TSPs for the preparation of the assessment required by subsection (c)
of this section. At a minimum, the following information must be reported to ERCOT.
(1) TSPs will provide ERCOT with information on planned and existing transmission outages.
(2) Generation entities will provide ERCOT with information on planned and existing generation
outages.
(3) Load entities will provide ERCOT with information on planned and existing availability of load
resources, specified by type of ancillary service.
(4) Generation entities will provide ERCOT with a complete list of generation resource availability and

§25.506. Publication of Resource and Load Information in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Power
Region.
(a) General Requirements. To increase the transparency of the ERCOT-administered markets, ERCOT must
post the information required in this section at a publicly accessible location on its website. In no event will
ERCOT disclose competitively sensitive consumption data. The information released must be made
available to all market participants.
(b) ERCOT will post the following information in aggregated form, for each settlement interval and for each
area where available, two calendar days after the day for which the information is accumulated:
(1) quantities and prices of offers for energy and each type of ancillary capacity service, in the form of
supply curves;
(2) self-arranged energy and ancillary capacity services, for each type of service;
(3) actual resource output;
(4) load and resource output for all entities that dynamically schedule their resources;
(5) actual load; and
(6) energy bid curves, cleared energy bids, and cleared load.
(c) ERCOT will post the following information in entity-specific form, for each settlement interval, 60 calendar
days after the day for which the information is accumulated, except where inapplicable or otherwise
prescribed. Resource-specific offer information must be linked to the name of the resource (or identified as
a virtual offer), the name of the entity submitting the information, and the name of the entity controlling the
resource. If there are multiple offers for the resource, ERCOT must post the specified information for each
offer for the resource, including the name of the entity submitting the offer and the name of the entity
controlling the resource. ERCOT will use §25.502(d) of this title (relating to Pricing Safeguards in Markets
Operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas) to determine the control of a resource and must include
this information in its market operations data system.
(1) Offer curves (prices and quantities) for each type of ancillary service and for energy in the real time
market, except that, for the highest-priced offer selected or dispatched for each interval on an
ERCOT-wide basis, ERCOT will post the offer price and the name of the entity submitting the offer
three calendar days after the day for which the information is accumulated.
(2) If the clearing prices for energy or any ancillary service exceeds a calculated value that is equal to
50 times a natural gas price index selected by ERCOT for each operating day, expressed in dollars
per megawatt-hour (MWh) or dollars per megawatt per hour, during any interval, the portion of
every market participant’s price-quantity offer pairs for balancing energy service and each other
ancillary service that is at or above a calculated value that is equal to 50 times a natural gas price
index selected by ERCOT for each operating day, expressed in dollars per MWh or dollars per
megawatt per hour, for that service and that interval must be posted seven calendar days after the
day for which the offer is submitted.
(3) Other resource-specific information, as well as self-arranged energy and ancillary capacity services,
and actual resource output, for each type of service and for each resource at each settlement point.
(4) The load and generation resource output, for each entity that dynamically schedules its resources.
(5) For each hour, transmission flows, voltages, transformer flows, voltages and tap positions (i.e., State
Estimator data). Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph and the provisions of paragraphs
(1) through (4) of this subsection, ERCOT must release relevant State Estimator data earlier than 60
days after the day for which the information is accumulated if, in its sole discretion, it determines
the release is necessary to provide a complete and timely explanation and analysis of unexpected
market operations and results or system events, including but not limited to pricing anomalies,
recurring transmission congestion, and system disturbances. ERCOT’s release of data in this event
must be limited to intervals associated with the unexpected market or system event as determined
by ERCOT. The data released must be made available simultaneously to all market participants.

§25.507--1 effective date 08/04/2022
(P 53493)
§25.507. Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Emergency Response Service (ERS).
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote reliability through provisions that provide ERCOT
flexibility in the implementation and administration of ERS.
(b) ERS procurement. ERCOT must procure ERS, a special emergency response service to be deployed by
ERCOT to help prevent or alleviate an actual or anticipated Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) event.
(1) ERCOT will determine the ERS standard contract terms under which ERS resources are obligated
to provide ERS, including renewal of ERS contract periods ERCOT deems necessary due to the
depletion of available ERS.
(2) ERCOT may spend a maximum of $75 million in a 12-month period on ERS, unless otherwise
determined by the commission. During that 12-month period, ERCOT may exceed the $75 million
maximum by up to an additional $25 million for ERS contract renewals under paragraph (d)(9) of
this section during a period where ERS has been exhausted. ERCOT may determine cost limits for
each ERS standard contract term in order to ensure that the ERS expenditure cap is not exceeded.
To minimize the cost of ERS, ERCOT may reject any offer that ERCOT determines to be
unreasonable or outside of the parameters of an acceptable offer. ERCOT may also reject any offer
placed on behalf of any ERS resource if ERCOT determines that it lacks a sufficient basis to verify
whether the ERS resource complied with ERCOT-established performance standards in an ERS
deployment event during the preceding ERS standard contract term.
(c) Definitions.
(1) ERS contract period -- A period defined by ERCOT for which an ERS resource is obligated to
provide ERS, consisting of all or part of the hours in an ERS standard contract term.
(2) ERS resource -- A resource contracted to provide ERS that meets one of the following descriptions:
(A) A load or aggregation of loads; or
(B) A dispatchable generator that is not registered with ERCOT as a Generation Resource, or
an aggregation of such generators.
(3) ERS standard contract term -- Periods for which ERCOT may procure ERS.
(4) ERS time period -- Set of hours designated by ERCOT within an ERS standard contract term.
(d) Participation in ERS. In addition to requirements established by ERCOT, the following requirements apply
for the provision of ERS:
(1) An ERS resource must be represented by a qualified scheduling entity (QSE).
(2) Offers must be submitted to ERCOT through a QSE.
(A) An offer may be submitted for one or more ERS time periods within an ERS contract
period.
(B) QSEs representing ERS resources may aggregate multiple loads to reach the minimum
capacity offer requirement established by ERCOT. Such aggregations will be considered
a single ERS resource for purposes of submitting offers.
(3) ERCOT must establish qualifications for QSEs and ERS resources to participate in ERS.
(4) A resource must not commit to provide ERS if it is separately obligated to provide response with
the same capacity during any of the same hours.
(5) ERCOT must establish performance criteria for QSEs and ERS resources.
(6) When dispatched by ERCOT, an ERS resource must deploy consistent with its obligations and must
remain deployed until recalled by ERCOT.
(7) ERCOT may deploy ERS as necessary, subject to the annual expenditure cap.
(8) Deployment of an ERS resource must be limited to the number of hours for which the service was
contracted, up to a maximum of 24 cumulative hours in an ERS contract period. However, if an
instruction causes the cumulative total ERS deployment time to exceed the number of hours 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.507--2 effective date 08/04/2022
(P 53493)
contracted within an ERS contract period, each ERS resource must remain deployed until permitted
by ERCOT procedures or by ERCOT instructions to return from deployment.
(9) Upon exhaustion of an ERS resource’s obligation in any ERS contract period, ERCOT may renew
that obligation, subject to the consent of the ERS resource and its QSE. ERCOT may renew the
obligation on each occasion that the resource’s obligation is exhausted. ERCOT may limit the
renewal quantity to manage the overall cost of the service or for reliability needs.
(10) ERCOT must establish procedures for testing of ERS resources.
(11) A resource with a pre-existing obligation to provide ERS may submit a proposal to serve as an
alternative to a resource subject to reliability must-run (RMR) service for the same period. If the
resource is selected, ERCOT must appropriately modify or terminate the resource’s pre-existing
ERS obligation to allow the resource to participate as an RMR alternative.
(e) ERS payment and charges.
(1) ERCOT must make a payment to each QSE representing an ERS resource on an as-bid basis, a
market clearing price mechanism, or such other mechanism as ERCOT deems appropriate, subject
to modifications determined by ERCOT based on the ERS resource’s availability during an ERS
standard contract term and the ERS resource’s performance in any deployment event.
(2) ERCOT must charge each QSE a charge for ERS based upon its load ratio share during the relevant
ERS time period and ERS standard contract term.
(3) ERCOT must settle an ERS contract period within 80 days following the completion of the ERS
standard contract term.
(f) Compliance.
(1) A QSE representing an ERS resource is subject to administrative penalties for noncompliance with
this rule or any related ERCOT Protocols, Operating Guides, or other ERCOT standards, by the
QSE or the ERS resource it represents.
(2) ERCOT must establish criteria for reducing a QSE’s payment, suspending a QSE from participation
in ERS, or both, for failure to meet its ERS obligations, and must also establish criteria for
subsequent reinstatement.
(3) ERCOT must establish criteria under which an ERS resource will be suspended for noncompliance
with this rule or any related ERCOT Protocols, Operating Guides, or other ERCOT standards, and
must also establish criteria for subsequent reinstatement.
(4) ERCOT must notify the commission of all instances of noncompliance with this rule or any related
ERCOT Protocols, Operating Guides, or other ERCOT standards.
(5) ERCOT must maintain records relating to any alleged noncompliance with this rule or any related
ERCOT Protocols, Operating Guides, or other ERCOT standards.
(g) Reporting. Prior to the start of an ERS standard contract term, ERCOT must report publicly the number of
megawatts (MW) procured per ERS time-period, the number and type of ERS resources providing the
service, and the projected total cost of the service for that ERS standard contract term. ERCOT must review
the effectiveness and benefits of ERS and report its findings to the commission annually by April 15 of each
calendar year. The report must contain, at a minimum, the number of MW procured in each period, the total
dollar amount spent, the number and duration of deployments, and the circumstances that led to each
deployment.
(h) Implementation. ERCOT must develop, in consultation with commission staff, additional procedures,
guides, technical requirements, protocols, or other standards that are consistent with this section and that
ERCOT finds necessary to implement ERS, including, but not limited to, developing a standard form ERS
Agreement and specific performance guidelines and grace periods for ERS resources.
(i) Self Provision. ERCOT must establish procedures for self-provision of ERS by any QSE.

§25.508. Reliability Standard for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Region.
(a) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings,
unless the context indicates otherwise.
(1) Exceedance tolerance -- the maximum acceptable percentage of simulations in which the
modeled ERCOT system experiences a loss of load event that exceeds the threshold for a given
criterion of the reliability standard.
(2) Loss of load event -- an occurrence when the system-wide firm load plus minimum operating
reserves required to avoid an energy emergency alert level three event is greater than the
available resource capacity to serve that load, resulting in involuntary load shed.
(3) Transmission operator -- has the same meaning as defined in the ERCOT protocols.
(4) Weatherization effectiveness -- the assumed percentage reduction in the amount of weatherrelated unplanned outages for generation resources and energy storage resources included in
the model, due to compliance with the weatherization standards in §25.55 of this title (relating
to Weather Emergency Preparedness).
(b) Reliability standard for the ERCOT region. The bulk power system for the ERCOT region meets
the reliability standard if an ERCOT probability-based model simulation demonstrates that the system
meets each of the criteria provided in this subsection.
(1) Frequency. The expected loss of load events for the ERCOT region must be equal to or less
than one event per ten years on average, i.e., 0.1 loss of load expectation (LOLE).
(2) Duration. The maximum expected length of a loss of load event for the ERCOT region,
measured in hours, must be less than 12 hours, with a 1.00 percent exceedance tolerance.
(3) Magnitude. The expected highest level of load shed during a loss of load event for the ERCOT
region, measured as the average lost load for a given hour, must be less than the maximum
number of megawatts of load shed that can be safely rotated during a loss of load event, as
determined by ERCOT, in consultation with commission staff and the transmission operators,
with a 1.00 percent exceedance tolerance. Beginning in 2024, on or before December 1 of
each year, ERCOT must file the maximum number of megawatts of load shed that can be
safely rotated during a loss of load event and a summary of the methodology used to calculate
this value.
(c) Reliability assessment. Beginning January 1, 2026, ERCOT must initiate an assessment to determine
whether the bulk power system for the ERCOT region is meeting the reliability standard and is likely
to continue to meet the reliability standard for the three years following the date of assessment. The
assessment must be conducted at least once every three years.
(1) Modeling assumptions.
(A) Before conducting the assessment, ERCOT must file a comprehensive list of
proposed modeling assumptions to be used in the reliability assessment. The proposed
assumptions must include:
(i) the number of historic weather years that will be included in the modeling;
(ii) the amount of new resources and retirements, in megawatts, listed by
resource type;
(iii) the weatherization effectiveness; and
(iv) any other assumptions that would impact the modeling results, along with
an explanation of the possible impact of the additional assumptions.
(B) Commission staff will provide interested persons with at least 30 days from the date
ERCOT files its proposed modeling assumptions to file comments recommending
modifications to ERCOT’s proposed modeling assumptions. Commission staff may
include filing requirements or additional questions for comment.

(2) Assessment components.
(A) ERCOT’s assessment must include review and analysis of the resource fleet, loads,
and other system characteristics for the ERCOT region for the following points in
time:
(i) the current year’s system configuration; and
(ii) the expected system configuration three years from the date of the current
year’s system analysis.
(B) The assessment results must include, at a minimum, the following metrics for each
point in time:
(i) the LOLE;
(ii) the probability of a loss of load event exceeding the duration threshold
established in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
(iii) the probability of a loss of load event exceeding the magnitude threshold
established in subsection (b)(3) of this section;
(iv) the expected unserved energy; and
(v) the normalized expected unserved energy.
(3) Commission review and determination.
(A) ERCOT must file its assessment with the commission, including any information
required under subparagraph (C)(i) of this paragraph.
(B) Commission staff will provide interested persons with at least 30 days from the date

staff may include filing requirements or additional questions for comment.
(C) If the assessment shows that any reviewed system fails to meet the reliability standard
described in subsection (b) of this section:
(i) ERCOT must provide the commission with a summary explanation of any
identified deficiencies and its supporting analysis. ERCOT must also
provide the commission with a menu of proposed recommended market
design changes, including a primary recommendation, that are intended to
address the identified deficiencies. ERCOT must provide the commission
with the expected system costs associated with each of its proposed
recommended changes;
(ii) the independent market monitor must conduct an independent review of
ERCOT’s proposed recommended market design changes, including
associated expected system costs for each proposed recommended change,
and file its review no later than the deadline established in subparagraph (B)
of this paragraph; and
(iii) commission staff must provide a recommendation to the commission,
considering expected system costs and reliability benefits, on whether any
market design changes or other changes may be necessary to address the
deficiency.

§25.509. Scarcity Pricing Mechanism for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Power Region.
(a) Definitions. The following terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings, unless the
context indicates otherwise:
(1) Emergency operations -- ERCOT entering into any level of Energy Emergency Alert.
(2) Generation entity -- an entity that owns or controls a generation resource.
(3) Generation resource -- a generator capable of providing energy or ancillary services to the
ERCOT grid and that is registered with ERCOT as a generation resource.
(4) Load entity -- an entity that owns or controls a load resource.
(5) Load resource -- a load capable of providing ancillary service to the ERCOT system or energy
in the form of demand response and is registered with ERCOT as a load resource.
(6) Resource entity -- an entity that is a generation entity or a load entity.
(b) Scarcity Pricing Mechanism (SPM). ERCOT will administer the SPM. The SPM will operate as
follows:
(1) The SPM will operate on a calendar year basis.
(2) For each day, the peaking operating cost (POC) will be 10 times the natural gas price index
value determined by ERCOT. The POC is calculated in dollars per megawatt-hour (MWh).
(3) For the purpose of this section, the real-time energy price (RTEP) will be measured as an
average system-wide price as determined by ERCOT.
(4) Beginning January 1 of each calendar year, the peaker net margin will be calculated as:
∑((RTEP – POC) * (number of minutes in a settlement interval / 60 minutes per hour)) for
each settlement interval when RTEP – POC >0.
(5) Each day, ERCOT will post at a publicly accessible location on its website the updated value
of the peaker net margin, in dollars per megawatt (MW).
(6) System-Wide Offer Caps.
(A) The low system-wide offer cap (LCAP) will be set at $2,000 per MWh for energy
offers and $2,000 per MW per hour for ancillary service offers.
(B) The high system-wide offer cap (HCAP) will be $5,000 per MWh for energy offers
and $5,000 per MW per hour for ancillary service offers.
(C) The system-wide offer cap will be set equal to the HCAP at the beginning of each
calendar year and maintained at this level until the peaker net margin during a
calendar year exceeds a threshold of three times the cost of new entry of new
generation plants.
(D) If the peaker net margin exceeds the threshold established in subparagraph (C) of this
paragraph during a calendar year, the system-wide offer cap will be set to the LCAP
for the remainder of that calendar year. In this event, ERCOT will continue to apply
the operating reserve demand curve and the reliability deployment price adder for the
remainder of that calendar year. Energy prices, exclusive of congestion prices, will
not exceed the LCAP plus $1 for the remainder of that calendar year.
(7) Reimbursement for Operating Losses when the LCAP is in Effect. When the system-wide
offer cap is set to the LCAP, ERCOT must reimburse resource entities for any actual marginal
costs in excess of the larger of the LCAP or the real-time energy price for the resource.
ERCOT must utilize existing settlement processes to the extent possible to verify the resource
entity’s costs for reimbursement.
(c) Emergency Pricing Program (EPP). ERCOT will administer the EPP. The EPP will operate as
follows.
(1) Activation of the EPP. The EPP must be activated if the system-wide energy price, as
determined by ERCOT, has been at the HCAP for 12 hours within a rolling 24-hour period.
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE

(2) Emergency Offer Cap (ECAP). While the EPP is active, the system-wide offer cap will be
set to the ECAP for both energy and ancillary service offers. The ECAP will be set equal to
the value of the LCAP.
(3) Duration of the EPP. The EPP will remain in effect until the later of:
(A) 24 hours after the activation of the EPP; or
(B) if ERCOT has entered into or remained in emergency operations while the EPP is
activated, 24 hours after ERCOT exits emergency operations without re-entering
emergency operations.
(4) Market Notice. ERCOT will issue a notice both when the EPP is activated and when the EPP
is terminated. The notice must include the date and time of the activation or termination of the
EPP.
(5) Reimbursement for Costs That Exceed the ECAP.
(A) While the EPP is active, ERCOT must reimburse resource entities for any actual
marginal costs in excess of the larger of the ECAP or the real-time energy price for
the resource. ERCOT must utilize existing settlement processes to the extent
practicable to verify the resource entity’s costs for reimbursement.
(B) For reimbursement of actual marginal costs in excess of the HCAP, a resource entity
must submit a reimbursement request in the manner prescribed by ERCOT. If a
resource entity fails to provide information to ERCOT in its reimbursement request,
as required by this subparagraph, ERCOT must not approve the reimbursement of the
resource entity’s fuel costs. This reimbursement request must include:
(i) for a resource entity requesting recovery of fuel costs, an attestation that the
costs submitted for recovery are solely related to the provision of fuel or
services directly related to the provision of the purchased fuel; and
(ii) any additional documents or information requested by ERCOT, including
fuel purchase contracts.
(C) ERCOT must allocate costs associated with this paragraph on a load ratio share basis.
(6) Report.
(A) Within 10 working days from the date the EPP is terminated, ERCOT must file an
initial report with the commission that contains the following information:

(ii) a final analysis of the EPP’s performance while the program was active;
(iii) the number of generators that filed for cost recovery under paragraph (5) of
this subsection;
(iv) the total dollar amount of costs submitted and costs recovered under
paragraph (5) of this subsection, including the fuel type, MW per hour, and
number of units associated with recovered costs; and
(v) any recommendations to modify or improve the EPP.
(7) Immediate Implementation. ERCOT must implement the EPP immediately.
Notwithstanding any conflicting language in this subsection, ERCOT may utilize a manual
process to activate the EPP and may consider the real-time energy price, exclusive of any
congestion, to determine the system-wide energy price, until any system and protocol changes
are complete. ERCOT must issue a market notice when it transitions from a manual to an
automated EPP activation process.
(d) Review of System-Wide Offer Cap Programs. Beginning January 1, 2026, and every five years
thereafter, the commission will review each of the system-wide offer cap programs to determine
whether to update aspects of each program.

§25.510. Texas Energy Fund In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §§34.0104,
34.0106, and 34.0108, which establish requirements and terms for loans to finance dispatchable electric
generating facilities within the ERCOT region.
(b) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings unless
the context indicates otherwise.
(1) Borrower -- An applicant to the Texas Energy Fund who is successfully awarded a loan under this
section and executes a loan agreement with the commission.
(2) Commercial operations date -- The resource commissioning date, as defined in the ERCOT
protocols, for the last generation resource that is part of an electric generating facility financed by
a loan under this section.
(3) Generation resource -- has the same meaning as defined in the ERCOT protocols.
(4) 12-Month performance availability factor (PAF) -- A metric calculated with ERCOT
availability and real time (RT) telemetered data for each generation resource in an electric
generating facility financed by a loan under this section. The PAF is computed as the average ratio
of each generation resource’s RT high sustainable limit (HSL) and its obligated capacity over a 12-
month measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Intervals that occurred during an approved
planned outage of a generation resource are excluded. The PAF is calculated as follows:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = ∑�
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 × 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐹𝐹 𝐹𝐹
𝑂𝑂 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶 �
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼 × 100.
“RT telemetered HSL” is the HSL telemetered by the generation resource in real time. “Available
flag” is a binary flag that is equal to the minimum of a current operating plan (COP) available flag
and an RT available flag. “COP available flag” is a binary flag that equals one if each hourly check
of the generation resource’s COP for the hour that includes the interval in question indicates the
generation resource will be available in that interval (i.e., any status other than OUT), with such
hourly checks starting at 14:30 on the day before the relevant interval; otherwise, the flag equals
zero. “RT available flag” is a binary flag that equals one if the RT telemetered resource status code
indicates the generation resource is available (i.e., any status other than OUT); otherwise, the flag
equals zero. For a generation resource that provides capacity to an industrial load or private use
network (PUN), obligated capacity is equal to the net capacity that is dedicated to ERCOT, as of
the commercial operations date. For all other generation resources, obligated capacity is equal to
the adjusted seasonal net max sustainable rating (defined as the registered ERCOT Seasonal Net
Max Sustainable Rating adjusted for planned derates). “Total evaluated period intervals” is equal
to the total number of intervals in the evaluation period, excluding any that occurred during an
approved planned outage of the generation resource.
(5) 12-Month planned outage factor (POF)—A metric calculated with ERCOT data for each
generation resource in an electric generating facility financed by a loan under this section. The
POF is computed as the percentage of time each generation resource spent in planned outages over
a 12-month measurement period. The POF is calculated as follows:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = �1 − 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼 � × 100.
“Total period intervals” is equal to the total number of intervals in the evaluation period. “Total
evaluated period intervals” is equal to the total number of intervals in the evaluation period that the
generation resource was not in a planned outage.

(h) Loan Terms and Agreements. A borrower must enter into one or more agreements with the commission
that include the terms of this section.
(1) Credit agreement -- the primary agreement between the borrower and the commission that will
govern the terms and conditions under which the commission will loan funds to the borrower. The
credit agreement will include the following key terms:
(A) Performance covenant -- each generation resource in an electric generating facility that
is financed by a loan under this section must maintain a PAF of at least 85 percent and a
POF no greater than 15 percent, evaluated monthly, over the trailing 12-month period,
throughout the term of the loan.
(B) Loan facility -- a senior secured first lien loan facility will be advanced to the borrower
in one or more drawdowns after the closing date of the credit agreement and upon
satisfaction of any conditions precedent, and may continue until the project achieves
commercial operation. Amortization schedules for the loan facilities will be determined
during due diligence and specified in the credit agreement.
(i) Upon initial closing of the credit agreement and after the borrower has met the
conditions precedent outlined in the loan agreement, the borrower may request
an initial loan disbursement for up to 60 percent of qualifying and documented
incurred expenses that are part of the total estimated cost of construction for the
project, as verified by the TEF administrator. Equity may be funded pro rata
with TEF debt or may be required in its entirety prior to funding of TEF debt,
based on the credit quality of the application and discretion of the commission
and as outlined in the loan agreement.
(ii) During the period of construction, the borrower may request loan disbursements
for up to 60 percent of the documented project construction and commissioning
costs.
(iii) For all loan disbursements, the borrower must submit a construction drawdown
certificate in the form specified by the commission. The TEF administrator will
review the construction drawdown certificate and, upon the TEF administrator’s
approval, will instruct the Texas Treasury Safekeeping Trust Company to
disburse funds.
(C) Other capital contributions. The TEF administrator will verify the borrower’s ability, or
the ability of the borrower’s corporate sponsor, to fund the required commitment of the
balance of no less than 40 percent of the construction and commissioning costs.
(D) Interest on the loan amounts disbursed under the credit agreement will accrue daily at a
fixed annual rate of three percent, starting at initial disbursement and continuing
throughout the term of the loan.
(E) Voluntary prepayment -- the borrower may voluntarily prepay the loan amount under the
credit agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, except that
the loan agreement may require that borrowers pay any breakage costs associated with
the loan, and the borrower must agree to adhere to the terms of the performance covenant
for the duration of the 20-year term.
(F) Collateral -- to secure the indebtedness under the credit agreement, the borrower, other
than an MOU or river authority, will grant the commission a first priority security interest
in all of its existing and after-acquired real and personal property related to the facility
and in all of the outstanding equity interests of the borrower in the facility.

agree to adhere to the terms of the performance covenant in paragraph (1)(A) of this
subsection and compliance and audit covenant in paragraph (1)(I) of this subsection for
the remainder of the 20-year term of the borrower’s loan. A change of ownership and
control will require the commission’s approval, and such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld. Upon approval of a change of ownership and control, the
acquiring third party must update the power generation company registration and the
generation resource registration to reflect the change of ownership and control. The
commission’s determination on a change of ownership does not impact any person’s
obligations under PURA §39.158.
(I) Compliance and audit covenants -- the credit agreement will include debt covenants
requiring the borrower to meet all statutory requirements for loan application eligibility
and a debt covenant requiring that the borrower submit annual financial audits and credit
assessments throughout the term of the loan. If the borrower’s electric generating facility
serves an industrial load or PUN, the borrower must also submit an annual accounting, at
the generation resource level, showing the capacity made available exclusively to the
ERCOT bulk power system during the performance year. The annual accounting must
consist of a comparison between the sum of the nameplate capacity of each generation
resource in the electric generating facility and the maximum non-coincident peak demand

standard form standby letter of credit template approved by the commission. The original
document of the standby letter of credit must be provided in a manner established by the
commission.
(B) The standby letter of credit must be issued by a financial institution that is supervised by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, or a state banking department and is a:
(i) U.S. domestic bank with an investment-grade credit rating; or
(ii) U.S. domestic office of a foreign bank with an investment-grade credit rating.
(2) The borrower may not withdraw the deposit from the escrow account or terminate its standby letter
of credit unless authorized by the commission.
(A) For deposits related to the construction of new facilities, the commission will authorize
the borrower’s withdrawal of its deposit funds or the release of the borrower’s standby
letter of credit, as applicable, if the facility for which the loan was provided is
interconnected in the ERCOT region:
(i) before the fourth anniversary of the date the initial loan funds were disbursed; or
(ii) after the fourth anniversary but before the fifth anniversary of the date the initial
loan funds were disbursed, if the commission finds that extenuating
circumstances caused the delay.
(B) For deposits related to upgrades to existing facilities, the commission will authorize the
borrower’s withdrawal of its deposit funds or the release of the borrower’s standby letter
of credit, as applicable, if the facility for which the loan was provided is completed:
(i) before the third anniversary of the date the initial loan funds were disbursed; or
(ii) after the third anniversary but before the fourth anniversary of the date the initial
loan funds were disbursed, if the commission finds that extenuating
circumstances caused a delay in the completion of the project.
(C) For the purpose of this subsection, interconnection occurs when the last generation
resource that is part of an electric generating facility financed by a loan under this section
is issued a resource commissioning date, as defined in the ERCOT protocols .
(3) Upon the occurrence of an event that entitles the borrower to withdraw its deposit or request
termination of its standby letter of credit--interconnection or completion of its project--the
borrower will file a notice of satisfaction with the commission stating that the borrower requests
the return of the deposit. The notice must state:
(A) A description of the event that the borrower asserts as justification for withdrawal of the
deposit or termination of the standby letter of credit, including the date on which the event
occurred and any relevant evidence required to support the assertion;
(B) The date of initial loan disbursement; and
(C) A detailed statement of extenuating circumstances, if any, that support the borrower’s
request for a late withdrawal of the deposit resulting from a delayed interconnection or
completion of the project, as described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) or (B)(ii) of this subsection.

(P 55826)
(4) The commission will evaluate each notice of satisfaction to determine whether the borrower is
entitled to withdrawal of its deposit or release of its standby letter of credit. If the borrower
demonstrates that it has satisfied the requirements for withdrawal, then the commission will instruct
the comptroller to return the deposit to the borrower or will release the borrower’s standby letter
of credit. If the commission determines that withdrawal is not authorized, including if the borrower
fails to file a timely notice of satisfaction, then it will instruct the comptroller to transfer the deposit
to the Texas Energy Fund or will direct a draw on the borrower’s standby letter of credit and deposit
the funds in the Texas Energy Fund.
(j) No Contested Case or Appeal. None of an application for a loan, a request for withdrawal of a deposit, or
a request for approval of a change of ownership is a contested case. Commission decisions on a loan
application or request for withdrawal of deposit are not subject to motions for rehearing or appeal under the
commission’s procedural rules.

hours, excluding any that occurred during an approved planned outage of the generation
resource. “Total period intervals” is equal to the total number of intervals during the assessed
hours.
(3) Interconnection date -- the resource commissioning date, as defined in the ERCOT
protocols, for the last generation resource in an electric generating facility for which an
applicant seeks a completion bonus grant award. The new electric generating facility or new
generation resources at an existing electric generating facility must meet the eligibility
criteria described in subsection (c) of this section.
(4) Performance reliability factor (PRF) -- a metric calculated with ERCOT availability and
real time (RT) telemetered data for each generation resource for which the commission
awards a completion bonus grant under this section. The PRF is computed as the average
ratio of each generation resource’s RT high sustainable limit (HSL) and its obligated capacity
over the assessed hours. Intervals that occurred during an approved planned outage of a
generation resource are excluded. The PRF is calculated as follows:
𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃 =
∑ � 𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 × 𝐴𝐴 𝐹𝐹
𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶 �
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼
× 100
“RT Telemetered HSL” is the HSL telemetered by the generation resource in real time.
“Available Flag” is a binary flag that is equal to the minimum of a current operating plan
(COP) available flag and a RT available flag. “COP available flag” is a binary flag that
equals one if each hourly check of the generation resource’s COP for the hour that includes
the interval in question indicates that the generation resource will be available in that interval
(i.e., any status other than OUT or EMRSWGR), with such hourly checks starting at 14:30
on the day before the relevant interval; otherwise, the flag equals zero. “RT available flag”
is a binary flag that equals one if the RT telemetered resource status code indicates the
generation resource is available (i.e., any status other than OUT or EMRSWGR); otherwise,
the flag equals zero. For a generation resource that provides capacity to an industrial load or
private use network (PUN), obligated capacity is equal to the net capacity that is dedicated
to ERCOT, as of the interconnection date. For all other generation resources, obligated

(P 55812)
capacity is equal to the adjusted seasonal net max sustainable rating (defined as the registered
ERCOT Seasonal Net Max Sustainable Rating adjusted for planned derates). “Total
evaluated period intervals” is equal to the total number of intervals during the assessed hours,
excluding any that occurred during an approved planned outage of the generation resource.

applicant must subsequently submit to the TEF administrator documentation
demonstrating that the interconnection date satisfies the applicable deadline in
subsection (e)(2) of this section and demonstrate adherence to the criteria described
in subsection (c) of this section. If the actual nameplate capacity or interconnection
date differs from estimates, the commission may revise the eligible applicant’s
completion bonus grant award amount to reflect actual information and amend the
notice of eligibility accordingly.
(B) For the ten successive test periods following a qualifying electric generating
facility’s interconnection date, an eligible applicant is authorized to receive an
annual completion bonus grant payment for each test period in which its generation
resource or resources meet the performance standard established in this section.
(C) An eligible applicant must enter into a grant agreement in the form and manner
specified by the commission whereby the eligible applicant commits to adhere to
the requirements described in subsection (c) of this section for the duration of any

enter into a grant agreement or breach of the executed grant agreement will be
grounds for the commission to determine that an applicant is ineligible to obtain any
future completion bonus grant payment.
(3) Information submitted to the commission in a completion bonus grant application is
confidential and not subject to disclosure under Chapter 552 of the Texas Government Code.
(4) An applicant must separately file a statement indicating that an application for a completion
bonus grant award has been presented to the commission for review with the date of
application submission.
(e) Completion bonus grant award amount.
(1) The amount of a completion bonus grant award is based on program funding availability, and
either
(A) the combined capacity of each new generation resource and interconnection date of
the new electric generating facility; or
(B) the combined capacity of each new generation resource and interconnection date of
the last new generation resource added to an existing electric generating facility.
(2) Unless the commission determines that extenuating circumstances justify extension of the
deadlines under this subsection, the commission may approve a completion bonus grant
award for an applicant considered eligible to receive a completion bonus grant award in an
amount not to exceed:
(A) $120,000 per MW of applicable capacity that is interconnected to the ERCOT
region before June 1, 2026; or
(B) $80,000 per MW of applicable capacity that is interconnected to the ERCOT region
on or after June 1, 2026, and before June 1, 2029.
(3) The applicable capacity for use in paragraph (1)(A) and (1)(B) of this subsection is:
(A) the combined nameplate capacity of all new generation resources, if the newly
constructed electric generating facility provides all capacity exclusively to the
ERCOT power region;

(P 55812)
(f) Grant payment process.
(1) For each test period, the TEF administrator will disburse a grant payment to an applicant
eligible to receive a completion bonus grant award. A grant payment is one-tenth of an
applicant’s total completion bonus grant award, subject to the performance standards and
discount methodology prescribed under subsections (g) and (h) of this section.
(2) No later than 45 days following the end of each test period, ERCOT must determine and
provide to the TEF administrator the assessed hours, the median and optimal performance
levels of the generation resources in the reference group, the PRF and ARF for each
generation resource in an electric generating facility under this section, and the amount of
payment each eligible applicant is entitled to for that test period, based on the performance
of each of its generation resources. The TEF administrator will provide each eligible
applicant the assessed hours, the median and optimal performance levels, the eligible
applicant’s PRF and ARF, and the eligible applicant’s calculated completion bonus grant
payment amount.
(3) ERCOT’s determination of a generation resource’s PRF and ARF and the calculation of the
applicant’s completion bonus award payment following a test period are subject to review
under Section 20 of the ERCOT protocols (alternative dispute resolution procedure) as
modified by this subsection. To seek review of ERCOT’s determination of PRF, ARF, or
payment amount, an eligible applicant must submit a written request for an alternative dispute
resolution proceeding to ERCOT no later than 30 days after the date the TEF administrator
provides PRF and ARF determinations and payment calculations to the eligible applicant for
the test period. The eligible applicant must simultaneously notify the TEF administrator in
writing in the manner prescribed by the commission that it has invoked review of ERCOT’s
determination of PRF or ARF or payment calculations. An eligible applicant may appeal the
outcome of the ERCOT review in accordance with §22.251(d) of this title (relating to Review
of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Conduct). The only parties to an appeal
of the ERCOT review are the eligible applicant, ERCOT, and commission staff.
(4) Thirty-five days after the TEF administrator provides the PRF, ARF, and completion bonus
grant payment amount to each eligible applicant, the TEF administrator will instruct the
Texas Treasury Safekeeping Trust Company to disburse the grant payment to the eligible
applicant and notify the eligible applicant of the disbursement, unless the eligible applicant
requests review of the determination of PRF or ARF under paragraph (3) of this subsection.
Upon resolution of a requested review, the TEF administrator will instruct the Texas Treasury
Safekeeping Trust Company to disburse the grant payment, if appropriate.
(g) Performance standards. An electric generating facility’s performance is based on the PRF and ARF
of each generation resource in the facility during the test period. The generation resource’s PRF will
be compared against the PRF of a reference group of non-grant recipient generation resources in the
ERCOT region. ERCOT, in consultation with commission staff, must select a reference group
comprising at least 30 resources randomly sampled from all dispatchable, interconnected, thermal
generation resources with a nameplate capacity of at least 50 MW that were first interconnected to the
ERCOT region on or after January 1, 2004. A grant payment may be discounted based on the formula
prescribed in subsection (h) of this section. The performance standards for any test period are as
follows:
(1) Optimal performance standard is determined by the 90th percentile of PRF scores achieved
by resources in the reference group during the assessed hours.
(2) Median performance standard is determined by the 50th percentile of PRF scores achieved by
resources in the reference group during the assessed hours.

§25.511 effective date 5/15/24
(P 55812)
(h) Grant payment discount formula. A grant payment equals one-tenth of an applicant’s completion
bonus grant award as stated in the applicant’s notice of eligibility, subject to discount or withholding.
Grant payments are calculated per generation resource. Each generation resource’s performance is
computed separately, and a grant payment for that generation resource calculated accordingly. The
total grant payment is summed from the individual generation resources’ grant payments, if applicable.
The formula for any discount of an annual grant payment is as follows:
𝐺𝐺 𝑃𝑃

⎩
⎨
⎧ 0, 𝑖𝑖 ≤ 𝑃𝑃 50
[1 − 10(1 − 𝐴𝐴 )2]�

�� δ, 𝑖𝑖 50 < 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃 < 𝑃𝑃 90
[1 − 10(1 − 𝐴𝐴 )2]δ, 𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃 ≥ 𝑃𝑃 90
Where δ is equal to one-tenth of the applicant’s completion bonus grant award based on the
applicant’s notice of eligibility, 𝑃𝑃 50 denotes the median performance standard, and 𝑃𝑃 90
denotes the optimal performance standard.
(1) Discount or withholding of payment.
(A) The TEF administrator will not apply any discount to a grant payment if the
generation resource meets or exceeds the optimal PRF performance standard
established under subsection (g)(1) of this section and achieves an ARF of between
0.9 and one.
(B) The TEF administrator will disburse a discounted grant payment if the PRF of the
generation resource for which the grant was provided is above the median
performance standard established under subsection (g)(2) of this section but less
than an optimal performance standard established under subsection (g)(1) of this
section, or if the ARF of the generation resource is less than 0.9.
(C) The TEF administrator will withhold a grant payment if the PRF of the generation
resource is equal to or below the median performance standard established under
subsection (g)(2) of this section, or if the generation resource’s calculation
according to the formula in this subsection returns a value less than or equal to zero.
(2) Example. An applicant would receive the following grant payments for hypothetical test
periods 1, 2, and 3 based on a $12,000,000 completion bonus grant award described in a
notice of eligibility for a 100 MW generation resource interconnected on March 1, 2026. The

has been presented to the commission for review with the date of the application submission,
the eligible objective and project, and the total grant amount requested per objective.
(d) Application review. The commission will approve in full, approve in part, or deny each project in an
application based on the screening and evaluation criteria outlined in this subsection. Evaluations and
other recommendations provided by the TEF administrator are advisory only. All final decisions on
whether to approve or deny each project will be made by the commission.
(1) Applications will be reviewed in the order in which the commission receives them.
(2) Applications and proposed projects will be screened for eligibility under subsection (b) of this
section.
(3) Each eligible project will be evaluated to determine whether it is reasonable. The following
factors may also be considered in the evaluation:
(A) the applicant’s past performance, personnel, and resources to implement the project;
(B) the project’s expected benefits;
(C) the project’s ability to address regional and reliability needs;
(D) the applicant’s stated priority level for the project;
(E) the project’s attributes;
(F) the project’s cost; and
(G) any other factors the commission deems appropriate.
(4) The TEF administrator may request that an applicant provide any additional information
necessary to screen and evaluate any project in an application.
(e) Grant award amount.
(1) The amount of a grant award is based on program funding availability and application
evaluation by the TEF administrator. Applications may be funded entirely, or the commission
may fund a portion of the proposed application.
(2) If a project is expected to benefit multiple states or power regions, the amount of grant funding
will be based on the percentage of the project’s benefits that are expected to be provided to
areas in Texas and outside of the ERCOT region.
(3) If a project is awarded for an electric generating facility that serves an industrial load or PUN,
the amount of grant funding will be based on the percentage of that electric generating facility’s
capacity that exclusively serves the power region or grid in which the electric generating
facility is located.
(4) Grants will be awarded only to fund eligible capital costs to implement a project in an approved
application. Any costs funded by a grant under this section must not be included in rates, or
otherwise collected from customers.
(5) A single applicant will not be awarded more than $200 million in grants under this section.
For purposes of this paragraph, grant funds awarded to joint applicants will be allocated to
each applicant based on terms in the grant agreement mutually agreed to by the joint applicants
and the TEF administrator.
(6) To receive a grant payment under this section, an applicant must enter into a grant agreement
in the form and manner specified by the commission. The TEF administrator may separate or

§25.512 effective date 3/05/25
(P 57004)
combine projects across applications into one or more grant agreements. An uncured breach
of the executed grant agreement will be grounds for the TEF administrator to determine that
an applicant is ineligible to obtain any future grant payments under this section. The TEF
administrator may tailor any applicable reporting requirements, period of performance,
milestones, performance metrics and targets, deliverables, and payment schedules for
individual projects, all of which will be included in the grant agreement.
(f) Grant payment terms.
(1) Payment terms for each project will be determined by the TEF administrator and specified in
the corresponding grant agreement. A grantee must comply with all terms and conditions
outlined in the grant agreement, including all reporting requirements, and all federal or state
statutes, rules, regulations, or guidance applicable to the grant award to be eligible for grant
fund disbursement.
(2) A grantee may receive grant funds in advance of incurring costs, as specified in the grant
agreement.
(3) The commission will withhold or require the return of payments for costs that are found
ineligible, or if a grantee fails to comply with the requirements described in paragraph (1) of
this subsection.
(g) Period of performance.
(1) Each project’s period of performance will be stated in the respective grant agreement based on
the project schedule provided in the grantee’s application. The grant agreement will specify
project milestones.
(2) Activities related to eligible costs of the project must commence within 12 months of execution
of the grant agreement. Project deadlines will be specified in the grant agreement.
(h) No contested case or appeal. An application for a grant under this section is not a contested case. A
commission decision on a grant award is not subject to a motion for rehearing or appeal under the
commission’s procedural rules.
(i) Project monitoring. Reporting and monitoring requirements for each grantee will be specified in the
grant agreement. Asset performance and maintenance will be monitored for a period specified in the
grant agreement for any asset funded by a grant under this section. The TEF administrator must track
each grantee’s project progress and provide the commission with regular updates.
(j) Expiration. This section expires September 1, 2050.

§25.517-1 effective 7/10/25
(P 57374)
§25.517. Exemption Process for ERCOT Reliability Requirements.
(a) Purpose and applicability. This section outlines a process at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
(ERCOT) for a resource entity to request an exemption from an ERCOT reliability requirement that
applies to existing resources. This section does not modify or otherwise preempt existing exemptions
or exemption processes contained in commission rules or ERCOT protocols, as that term is defined in
§25.5 of this title (relating to Definitions). This section also does not prohibit ERCOT from adopting
specific exemption processes for an individual reliability requirement that is not designated as a
requirement for which an exemption under this section is available or create a presumption that any
individual reliability requirement applies to an existing resource.
(1) ERCOT must designate during the development of a reliability requirement whether the
exemption process outlined in this section is available for that reliability requirement. This
designation must appear in the text of the approved reliability requirement.
(A) A reliability requirement designated under this paragraph must include a reasonable
deadline by which a resource entity must submit its exemption request to ERCOT.
ERCOT may extend this deadline.
(B) An exemption to a reliability requirement designated under this paragraph is available
only for a resource that had a resource commissioning date, as defined in the ERCOT
protocols, before the date a reliability requirement takes effect. An existing load
resource is one that completed Ancillary Service Qualification Testing, as defined in
the ERCOT protocols, before the date a reliability requirement takes effect.
(2) This section also applies to a reliability requirement that is already in effect on the effective
date of this section and for which ERCOT has accepted notices of intent to request an
exemption, but for which ERCOT has not yet defined the standards by which those exemption
requests will be evaluated.
(3) A threshold reliability risk described in subsection (b) of this section applies only to the
assessment of an exemption request under this section and does not apply to reliability criteria
in other ERCOT protocols.
(b) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings
unless the context indicates otherwise:
(1) Feasible -- describes an available modification or upgrade that can be made to a resource.
(2) Reliability requirement -- a mandatory technical standard adopted by ERCOT to support the
reliability of electric service that is included in the ERCOT protocols.
(3) Resource -- refers to a generation resource, load resource, or an energy storage resource, as
defined and used in the ERCOT protocols.
(4) Resource entity -- an entity that owns or controls a resource.
(5) Technical limitation -- a technical restriction preventing a resource from complying with a
reliability requirement, based on the resource’s documented inability to comply with the
reliability requirement.
(6) Threshold reliability risk -- one or more of the following:
(A) instability, cascading outages, or uncontrolled separation;
(B) loss of generation capacity equal to or greater than 500 megawatts in aggregate from
one or more resources other than the resource for which the exemption is requested;
(C) loss of load equal to or greater than 300 megawatts; or
(D) equipment damage.
(c) Exemption Request. If a technical limitation prevents a resource from complying with a reliability
requirement, a resource entity may submit to ERCOT an exemption request in accordance with this
section by the deadline established by ERCOT under subsection (a) of this section. ERCOT must treat
information submitted as part of an exemption request as protected information. The exemption request 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.517 effective date 7/10/25
(P 57374)
must be submitted in a manner prescribed by ERCOT that, at a minimum, requires the following:
(1) a description of the applicable reliability requirement from which the resource entity seeks an
exemption, including cross-references to ERCOT protocols where the applicable reliability
requirement is contained;
(2) a succinct description, with supporting documentation, of the resource entity’s efforts to
comply with the applicable reliability requirement, and an explanation of the resource entity’s
inability to comply;
(3) documentation describing all feasible modifications, replacements, or upgrades the resource
entity could implement, but has not yet implemented, to improve the performance of the
resource toward meeting the applicable reliability requirement;
(4) models that accurately represent expected resource performance and reflect the actual, as-built
resource equipment and settings, with all technical limitations, before and after maximizing
the resource’s operational capability, if applicable, and if not already submitted to ERCOT.
Each model must include a description of any technical limitation the resource entity cannot
accurately represent in that model;
(5) a plan to comply with each specific element of the applicable reliability requirement to the
maximum extent possible. A plan under this paragraph must include:
(A) a proposed completion deadline for each proposed modification, replacement, or
upgrade;
(B) proposed dates for the resource entity to provide updates to ERCOT on its progress;
(C) any supporting documentation relevant to plan implementation; and
(D) potential mitigation options, if applicable;
(6) whether any other exemption request has been submitted for the resource, in accordance with
this section or otherwise, including the outcome of each request;
(8) the resource’s interconnection date, including a copy of the resource’s interconnection
agreement and any amendments, if not already submitted to ERCOT; and
(9) whether the resource entity is seeking an exemption, an extension, or both.
(d) ERCOT assessment of exemption requests.
(1) Assessment process. ERCOT must assess the ERCOT system to determine whether an
exemption granted to one resource or several resources would result in a threshold reliability
risk to the ERCOT system . ERCOT must identify the resource’s interconnecting TSP and
send the TSP all studies and substantive communications related to the exemption request and
ERCOT’s assessment and may consider input from the interconnecting TSP, as appropriate.
The assessment must consider at least the following:
(A) steady state and dynamic stability of the ERCOT system;
(B) resource and system performance under a reasonable set of operating conditions (e.g.,
peak summer, peak winter, high wind low load, and nighttime conditions);
(C) reasonable and expected topology, equipment status, and dispatch used in the
assessment;
(D) any contingencies ERCOT deems critical based on engineering judgment, including
contingencies from any applicable North American Electric Reliability Corporation
reliability standard, such as any allowed steady state system adjustments for
contingencies, or from the ERCOT planning guide;
(E) any technical limitations described in the request that are not included in the models
provided by the resource entity under subsection (c)(4) of this section, the effect of
which will be assessed by analyzing the expected impact based on ERCOT’s
engineering judgment;
(F) ERCOT’s most relevant outlook for resource adequacy;
(G) the potential impact to system reliability of new resources that have been approved
for energization by ERCOT;
(H) any mitigation options included in the exemption request under subsection (c)(5)(D) 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.517 effective date 7/10/25
(P 57374)
of this section; and
(I) any other information ERCOT deems necessary to assess the reliability impact of an
exemption based on ERCOT’s engineering judgment.
(2) Process to determine mitigation options. Before making a final decision to grant an
exemption or extension with conditions or deny an exemption or extension, ERCOT must
make a reasonable effort to work with the resource entity that made the request to identify any
technical or operational options that are mutually acceptable to ERCOT and the resource entity
to mitigate any threshold reliability risk caused by the resource’s continued operation. ERCOT
may request and consider additional information from the resource entity during this process,
including costs of an individual option. Failure to identify a mutually acceptable option does
not prevent ERCOT from making a final decision on the requested exemption or extension
based on its assessment.
(3) Assessment outcomes. ERCOT may grant an exemption, grant an exemption with conditions,
grant an extension, or deny an exemption. ERCOT must provide the resource entity with a
written explanation for its decision that includes information on its assessment, including
which models ERCOT used in the assessment, a list of assumptions that were used in the
assessment, and which factors were varied to run any sensitivities.
(A) ERCOT must grant an exemption if its assessment identifies that no threshold
reliability risks would result from granting the exemption or, if applicable, granting
several exemptions requested by multiple resource entities.
(B) ERCOT may grant an exemption with conditions (e.g., curtailment of the resource’s
output under certain circumstances, a congestion management plan, or other remedial
action) if doing so would no longer result in a threshold reliability risk.
(C) ERCOT may grant an extension or an extension with conditions if it determines that
a feasible solution acceptable to both it and the resource entity will become available
within a reasonable time.
(D) ERCOT must deny the exemption request if its assessment identifies that a threshold
reliability risk would result from granting the exemption or, if applicable, granting
several exemptions requested by multiple resources entities, that cannot be eliminated
by imposing conditions.
(4) An exemption under this section may be limited to a period identified by ERCOT in granting
the exemption.
(5) If ERCOT denies an exemption request, ERCOT may specify in its written explanation a
reasonable amount of time for the resource to come into compliance with the reliability
requirement from which the resource entity was seeking an exemption.
(e) ERCOT inspections. ERCOT may inspect a resource owned and operated by a resource entity to
verify the need for an exemption or perform field verification of modeling parameters, using employees
or ERCOT-designated contractors.
(1) ERCOT must provide the resource entity at least 72 hours’ written notice of a field visit unless
otherwise agreed by that resource entity and ERCOT. The written notice must identify each
ERCOT employee, commission staff member, or designated contractor participating in the
inspection. Within 24 hours of receiving notice of inspection, a resource entity must provide
ERCOT, commission staff, and designated contractors all resource entity requirements for
facility access. Upon provision of the required written notice, a resource entity must grant
access to its facility to ERCOT and to commission staff, including an employee of a contractor
designated by ERCOT to conduct, oversee, or observe the inspection.
(2) During the inspection, a resource entity must provide ERCOT, commission staff, or designated
contractors access to any part of the facility upon request. ERCOT, commission staff, and
designated contractors must comply with all applicable safety and security regulations,
including those maintained by the resource entity, during the inspection. A resource entity
must provide access to inspection, maintenance, and other records associated with the 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.517 effective date 7/10/25
(P 57374)
applicable reliability requirement and must make the resource entity’s staff available to answer
questions. A resource entity may escort ERCOT, commission staff, and designated contractors
at all times during an inspection. During the inspection, ERCOT, commission staff, or
designated contractors may take photographs or video recordings of any part of the facility,
except control rooms, and may conduct interviews of facility personnel designated by the
resource entity. Documents, photographs, and video recordings collected or generated by
ERCOT, commission staff, or designated contractors during or related to the inspection will
be treated as confidential information under applicable state or federal laws and regulations.
ERCOT may require additional documentation from the resource or conduct its own
verifications, as ERCOT deems necessary.
(f) Complaint to commission. If a resource entity is not satisfied with ERCOT’s determination of that
resource entity’s request under subsection (d) of this section, the resource entity may file a complaint
under §22.251 of this title (relating to Review of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)
Conduct).
(g) Validity and revocation. An exemption may become invalid, or ERCOT may revoke or modify an
exemption, under the circumstances listed in this subsection. ERCOT must notify the resource entity’s
interconnecting TSP of any changes to the status of an exemption.
(1) Expiration. An exemption is valid for the period identified by ERCOT in granting the
exemption or the period in the commission’s order ruling on an exemption under §22.251 of
this title. If an exemption expires, the resource entity may request an extension of the
exemption, and ERCOT may grant an extension, provided that granting the extension does not
result in a threshold reliability risk. ERCOT may develop procedures to implement this
provision, including establishing extension request deadlines for a group of exemptions to a
reliability requirement that will expire at the same time. ERCOT may request any information
reasonable and necessary to evaluate a request under this paragraph.
(2) Resource modification. An exemption is no longer valid if a modification described in this
paragraph is made to the resource. After such a modification, the resource must meet the latest
reliability requirements in the ERCOT protocols.
(A) A modification that involves changing the inverter, turbine, generator, battery
modules, or power converter associated with a facility with an aggregate real power
rating of ten MW or greater, unless the replacement is in kind.
(B) A modification that involves changing the specific equipment with the technical
limitation, unless the replacement is in kind.
(3) Revocation. An exemption or extension may be revoked or modified if an anticipated or
actual system disturbance or a reliability study indicates that the resource’s continued
operation with the exemption or extension results in a threshold reliability risk.
(A) If the exemption or extension was granted by ERCOT under this section, then the
following provisions apply:
(i) If ERCOT determines that it is necessary to revoke or modify an exemption
or extension, it must inform the resource entity, the resource entity’s
interconnecting TSP, and the commission of its determination, in writing,
and this notice must include a justification for the action.
(ii) Before revoking or modifying an exemption or extension, ERCOT must
make reasonable efforts as described under subsection (d)(2) of this section
to find mutually acceptable mitigation solutions to avoid a threshold
reliability risk. However, if necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid,
ERCOT may temporarily suspend an exemption or extension, or impose
temporary mitigation measures, pending its final decision under this
subparagraph.
(iii) After making reasonable efforts as described under subsection (d)(2) of this 
CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE
PROVIDERS.
Subchapter S. WHOLESALE MARKETS.
§25.517 effective date 7/10/25
(P 57374)
section, ERCOT must issue a final decision whether to revoke, modify, or
continue the exemption or extension. If ERCOT revokes or modifies the
exemption or extension, ERCOT must share the information required under
subsection (d)(3) of this section with the resource entity, the resource
entity’s interconnecting TSP, and the commission, in writing, and give the
resource entity a reasonable period in which to come into compliance with
the reliability requirement or implement necessary mitigatory actions.
(iv) If a resource entity is unsatisfied with ERCOT’s final decision under this
subparagraph, it may contest the decision by filing a complaint with the
commission consistent with the procedure in subsection (f) of this section.
For purposes of this clause, the resource entity’s complaint will be treated
like a complaint relating to a decision made by ERCOT under subsection (d)
of this section.
(B) If the exemption or extension was granted by the commission in response to a
complaint filed under §22.251 of this title, the following provisions apply:
(i) If an anticipated or actual system disturbance or a reliability study indicates
that continued operation of a resource with an exemption or extension results
in a threshold reliability risk, ERCOT may file a petition with the
commission to revoke or modify the extension or exemption. ERCOT must
provide notice of this petition to all of the parties in the proceeding in which
the exemption or extension was granted by the commission.
(ii) ERCOT may request interim relief during the pendency of the petition for
good cause to ensure the reliability of the grid. ERCOT may temporarily
suspend an exemption or extension, or impose temporary mitigation
measures, for fifteen days or until the presiding officer rules on its request
for interim relief, whichever is shorter.
(iii) The commission may grant ERCOT’s petition if doing so is in the public
interest. In making its determination, the commission may consider any
relevant information, including evidence of reliability risks or operational or
economic impacts to the resource entity.
(4) The commission may initiate a review of an exemption or extension on its own motion or in
response to a filing by ERCOT.
(h) Nothing in this section reduces or otherwise adversely affects ERCOT’s authority to prudently operate
the grid, regardless of whether a resource has been granted an exemption.
